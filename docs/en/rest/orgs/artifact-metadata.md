# REST API endpoints for artifact metadata

Use these endpoints to retrieve and manage metadata for artifacts in your organization. Artifact metadata provides information about build artifacts, their provenance, and related details.

You can use these endpoints to upload storage and deployment records for software that your organization builds with GitHub Actions. The records are displayed on the organization's linked artifacts page. See [About linked artifacts](/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/linked-artifacts).

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## Create an artifact deployment record

```
POST /orgs/{org}/artifacts/metadata/deployment-record
```

Create or update deployment records for an artifact associated
with an organization.
This endpoint allows you to record information about a specific
artifact, such as its name, digest, environments, cluster, and
deployment.
The deployment name has to be uniqe within a cluster (i.e a
combination of logical, physical environment and cluster) as it
identifies unique deployment.
Multiple requests for the same combination of logical, physical
environment, cluster and deployment name will only create one
record, successive request will update the existing record.
This allows for a stable tracking of a deployment where the actual
deployed artifact can change over time.

### Parameters

#### Headers

* **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

* **`org`** (string) (required)
  The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.

#### Body parameters

* **`name`** (string) (required)
  The name of the artifact.

* **`digest`** (string) (required)
  The hex encoded digest of the artifact.

* **`version`** (string)
  The artifact version.

* **`status`** (string) (required)
  The status of the artifact. Can be either deployed or decommissioned.
  Can be one of: `deployed`, `decommissioned`

* **`logical_environment`** (string) (required)
  The stage of the deployment.

* **`physical_environment`** (string)
  The physical region of the deployment.

* **`cluster`** (string)
  The deployment cluster.

* **`deployment_name`** (string) (required)
  The unique identifier for the deployment represented by the new record. To accommodate differing
  containers and namespaces within a cluster, the following format is recommended:
  {namespaceName}-{deploymentName}-{containerName}.

* **`tags`** (object)
  The tags associated with the deployment.

* **`runtime_risks`** (array of strings)
  A list of runtime risks associated with the deployment.
  Supported values are: critical-resource, internet-exposed, lateral-movement, sensitive-data

* **`github_repository`** (string)
  The name of the GitHub repository associated with the artifact. This should be used
  when there are no provenance attestations available for the artifact. The repository
  must belong to the organization specified in the path parameter.
  If a provenance attestation is available for the artifact, the API will use
  the repository information from the attestation instead of this parameter.

* **`return_records`** (boolean)
  If true, the endpoint will return the created or updated record in the response body.
  Default: `true`

### HTTP response status codes

* **200** - Artifact deployment record stored successfully.

* **403** - Forbidden

* **404** - Resource not found

### Code examples

#### Example

**Request:**

```curl
curl -L \
  -X POST \
  https://api.github.com/orgs/ORG/artifacts/metadata/deployment-record \
  -d '{
  "name": "awesome-image",
  "digest": "sha256:1bb1e949e55dcefc6353e7b36c8897d2a107d8e8dca49d4e3c0ea8493fc0bc72",
  "status": "deployed",
  "logical_environment": "prod",
  "physical_environment": "pacific-east",
  "cluster": "moda-1",
  "deployment_name": "deployment-pod",
  "tags": {
    "data-access": "sensitive"
  }
}'
```

**Response schema (Status: 200):**

* `total_count`: required, integer
* `deployment_records`: array of `Artifact Deployment Record`:
  * `id`: integer
  * `digest`: string
  * `logical_environment`: string
  * `physical_environment`: string
  * `cluster`: string
  * `deployment_name`: string
  * `tags`: object, additional properties: string
  * `runtime_risks`: array of string, enum: `critical-resource`, `internet-exposed`, `lateral-movement`, `sensitive-data`
  * `created_at`: string
  * `updated_at`: string
  * `attestation_id`: integer or null

## Set cluster deployment records

```
POST /orgs/{org}/artifacts/metadata/deployment-record/cluster/{cluster}
```

Set deployment records for a given cluster.
If proposed records in the 'deployments' field have identical 'cluster', 'logical\_environment',
'physical\_environment', and 'deployment\_name' values as existing records, the existing records will be updated.
If no existing records match, new records will be created.
Note: Artifacts are uniquely identified by the combination of their repository and digest fields. If two entries in the deployments
array resolve to the same repository and have identical digest fields but differing name and version fields, the endpoint will use
the artifact name and version from the record processed first, since a single artifact (identified by repository and digest) can
only have one name and version.

### Parameters

#### Headers

* **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

* **`org`** (string) (required)
  The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.

* **`cluster`** (string) (required)
  The cluster name.

#### Body parameters

* **`logical_environment`** (string) (required)
  The stage of the deployment.

* **`physical_environment`** (string)
  The physical region of the deployment.

* **`deployments`** (array of objects) (required)
  The list of deployments to record.
  * **`name`** (string) (required)
    The name of the artifact.
  * **`digest`** (string) (required)
    The hex encoded digest of the artifact.
  * **`version`** (string)
    The artifact version.
  * **`status`** (string)
    The deployment status of the artifact.
    Default: `deployed`
    Can be one of: `deployed`, `decommissioned`
  * **`deployment_name`** (string) (required)
    The unique identifier for the deployment represented by the new record. To accommodate differing
    containers and namespaces within a record set, the following format is recommended:
    {namespaceName}-{deploymentName}-{containerName}.
    The deployment\_name must be unique across all entries in the deployments array.
  * **`github_repository`** (string)
    The name of the GitHub repository associated with the artifact. This should be used
    when there are no provenance attestations available for the artifact. The repository
    must belong to the organization specified in the path parameter.
    If a provenance attestation is available for the artifact, the API will use
    the repository information from the attestation instead of this parameter.
  * **`tags`** (object)
    Key-value pairs to tag the deployment record.
  * **`runtime_risks`** (array of strings)
    A list of runtime risks associated with the deployment.
    Supported values are: critical-resource, internet-exposed, lateral-movement, sensitive-data

* **`partial_success`** (boolean)
  When enabled, deployments associated with repositories the actor can write to are processed
  while deployments associated with repositories that cannot be resolved or written to by the actor
  are skipped and reported in the errors array. When false (the default), the endpoint returns
  an error if any targeted repository cannot be resolved, the actor lacks write access, or no matching attestation can be found.
  Default: `false`

* **`return_records`** (boolean)
  If true, the endpoint will return the set records in the response body
  Default: `true`

### HTTP response status codes

* **200** - Deployment records created or updated successfully.

* **207** - This response format is only returned when partial\_success is set to true in the request body.
  Successfully processed deployments are included in the deployment\_records field. Records that could
  not be processed and were skipped because of unresolvable repositories, missing actor permissions, or lack of a matching attestation are
  included in the errors field.

* **403** - Forbidden

* **404** - Resource not found

### Code examples
