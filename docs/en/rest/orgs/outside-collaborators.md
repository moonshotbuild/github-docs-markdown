# REST API endpoints for outside collaborators

Use the REST API to manage outside collaborators.

> [!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## Convert an organization member to outside collaborator

```
PUT /orgs/{org}/outside_collaborators/{username}
```

When an organization member is converted to an outside collaborator, they'll only have access to the repositories that their current team membership allows. The user will no longer be a member of the organization. For more information, see "Converting an organization member to an outside collaborator". Converting an organization member to an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise administrators. For more information, see "Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise."

- **`username`** (string) (required)
  The handle for the GitHub user account.

#### Body parameters

- **`async`** (boolean)
  When set to true, the request will be performed asynchronously. Returns a 202 status code when the job is successfully queued.

### HTTP response status codes
