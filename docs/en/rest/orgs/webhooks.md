# REST API endpoints for organization webhooks

Use the REST API to interact with webhooks in an organization.

## About organization webhooks

Organization webhooks allow your server to receive HTTP `POST` payloads whenever certain events happen in an organization. For more information, see [Webhooks documentation](/en/webhooks).

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List organization webhooks

```
GET /orgs/{org}/hooks
```

List webhooks for an organization.
The authenticated user must be an organization owner to use this endpoint.
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need admin:org\_hook scope. OAuth apps cannot list, view, or edit
webhooks that they did not create and users cannot list, view, or edit webhooks that were created by OAuth apps.

  The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."
  Default: `30`

* **`page`** (integer)

  Default: `1`

### HTTP response status codes

* **200** - OK
