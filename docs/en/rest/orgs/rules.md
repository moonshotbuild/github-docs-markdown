# REST API endpoints for rules

Use the REST API to manage rulesets for organizations. Organization rulesets control how people can interact with selected branches and tags in repositories in an organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## Get all organization repository rulesets

```
GET /orgs/{org}/rulesets
```

Get all the repository rulesets for an organization.

### Parameters

#### Headers

- **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

- **`org`** (string) (required)
  The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.

- **`per_page`** (integer)
  The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."
  Default: `30`

- **`page`** (integer)
  The page number of the results to fetch. For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."

- **`targets`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of rule targets to filter by.
If provided, only rulesets that apply to the specified targets will be returned.
For example, branch,tag,push.
