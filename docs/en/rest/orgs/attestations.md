# REST API endpoints for artifact attestations

Use the REST API to interact with artifact attestations.

> [!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List attestations by bulk subject digests

```
POST /orgs/{org}/attestations/bulk-list
```

List a collection of artifact attestations associated with any entry in a list of subject digests owned by an organization.
The collection of attestations returned by this endpoint is filtered according to the authenticated user's permissions; if the authenticated user cannot read a repository, the attestations associated with that repository will not be included in the response. In addition, when using a fine-grained access token the attestations:read permission is required.
Please note: in order to offer meaningful security benefits, an attestation's signature and timestamps must be cryptographically verified, and the identity of the attestation signer must be validated. Attestations can be verified using the GitHub CLI attestation verify command. For more information, see our guide on how to use artifact attestations to establish a build's provenance.

### Parameters

#### Headers

- **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.
