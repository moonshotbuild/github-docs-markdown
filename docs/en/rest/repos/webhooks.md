# REST API endpoints for repository webhooks

Use the REST API to create and manage webhooks for your repositories.

## About repository webhooks

Repository webhooks allow your server to receive HTTP `POST` payloads whenever certain events happen in a repository. For more information, see [Webhooks documentation](/en/webhooks).

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List repository webhooks

```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/hooks
```

Lists webhooks for a repository. last response may return null if there have not been any deliveries within 30 days.

### Parameters

## Create a repository webhook

share the same config as long as those webhooks do not have any events that overlap.

  The name of the repository without the .git extension. The name is not case sensitive.
