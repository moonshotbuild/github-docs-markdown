# Billing usage

Use the REST API to get billing usage information.

The endpoints on this page return usage that is billed to the account associated with the endpoint. For help deciding which level of usage to report on, see [Automating usage reporting with the REST API](/en/billing/tutorials/automate-usage-reporting#step-1-decide-what-level-to-report-on).

* User endpoints return Copilot usage that is billed directly to an individual user’s personal account. These endpoints are only applicable if the user has purchased their own Copilot plan.
* If a user’s Copilot license is managed and billed through an organization or enterprise, their usage is not included in user-level endpoints. In that case, you must use the organization- or enterprise-level endpoints instead.

To view enterprise-level endpoints, select the dropdown menu at the top of the page and switch from Free, Pro, & Team to GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.
