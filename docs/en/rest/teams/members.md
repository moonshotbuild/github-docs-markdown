# REST API endpoints for team members

Use the REST API to create and manage membership of teams in your GitHub organization.

## About team members

These endpoints are only available to authenticated members of the team's [organization](/en/rest/orgs). OAuth access tokens require the `read:org` [scope](/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps). GitHub generates the team's `slug` from the team `name`.

Where `pull` and `push` permissions are accepted, these will map to the **Read** and **Write** roles for an organization repository. For more information about repository roles, see [Repository roles for an organization](/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization).

> \[!NOTE]
> When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API to make changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see [Managing team synchronization for your organization](/en/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/managing-team-synchronization-for-your-organization).

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List pending team invitations

```
GET /orgs/{org}/teams/{team_slug}/invitations
```

The return hash contains a role field which refers to the Organization Invitation role and will be one of the following values: direct\_member, admin, billing\_manager, hiring\_manager, or reinstate. If the invitee is not a GitHub member, the login field in the return hash will be null.
Note

You can also specify a team by org\_id and team\_id using the route GET /organizations/{org\_id}/team/{team\_id}/invitations.

To get a user's membership with a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.
Note

Note

The response contains the state of the membership and the member's role.

The role for organization owners is set to maintainer. For more information about maintainer roles, see Create a team.

### Parameters

* **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

* **`org`** (string) (required)
  The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.

  The slug of the team name.

* **`username`** (string) (required)
  The handle for the GitHub user account.

## Add or update team membership for a user

```
PUT /orgs/{org}/teams/{team_slug}/memberships/{username}
```

Adds an organization member to a team. An authenticated organization owner or team maintainer can add organization members to a team.
Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see GitHub's products in the GitHub Help documentation.
Note

When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub."

An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team's organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team.
If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.
Note

You can also specify a team by org\_id and team\_id using the route PUT /organizations/{org\_id}/team/{team\_id}/memberships/{username}.

### Parameters

#### Headers

* **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

* **`org`** (string) (required)
  The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.

* **`team_slug`** (string) (required)
  The slug of the team name.

* **`username`** (string) (required)
  The handle for the GitHub user account.

#### Body parameters

* **`role`** (string)
  The role that this user should have in the team.
  Default: `member`
  Can be one of: `member`, `maintainer`

### HTTP response status codes

* **200** - OK

* **403** - Forbidden if team synchronization is set up

* **422** - Unprocessable Entity if you attempt to add an organization to a team

### Code examples

#### Add or update team membership for an organization member

**Request:**

```curl
curl -L \
  -X PUT \
  https://api.github.com/orgs/ORG/teams/TEAM_SLUG/memberships/USERNAME \
  -d '{
  "role": "maintainer"
}'
```

**Response schema (Status: 200):**

Same response schema as [Get team membership for a user](#get-team-membership-for-a-user).

## Remove team membership for a user

```
DELETE /orgs/{org}/teams/{team_slug}/memberships/{username}
```

To remove a membership between a user and a team, the authenticated user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the organization that the team is associated with. Removing team membership does not delete the user, it just removes their membership from the team.
Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see GitHub's products in the GitHub Help documentation.
Note

When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub."

Note

You can also specify a team by org\_id and team\_id using the route DELETE /organizations/{org\_id}/team/{team\_id}/memberships/{username}.

### Parameters
