# REST API endpoints for Copilot Spaces

Use the REST API to manage Copilot Spaces and related resources.

> [!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List organization Copilot Spaces

```
GET /orgs/{org}/copilot-spaces
```

Lists Copilot Spaces owned by an organization. The authenticated user must have read access to the organization's Copilot Spaces.
Only Spaces that are readable by the authenticated user are returned. This includes public Spaces and internal Spaces if the user is a member of the organization.
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the read:org scope to use this endpoint.
Fine-grained tokens and GitHub App user access tokens must have been granted access to the organization that owns the space. They must also have been granted access to every repository referenced by resources in a space; spaces with inaccessible resources are omitted from the response.

### Parameters

#### Headers

- **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

- **`org`** (string) (required)
  The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.

- **`per_page`** (integer)
  The number of results per page (max 100).
  Default: `30`

- **`before`** (string)
  A cursor, as given in the Link header. If specified, the query only searches for results before this cursor.

- **`after`** (string)
  A cursor, as given in the Link header. If specified, the query only searches for results after this cursor.
