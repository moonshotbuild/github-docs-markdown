# REST API endpoints for {% data variables.product.prodname\_dependabot\_alerts %}

Use the REST API to interact with Dependabot alerts for a repository.

> \[!NOTE]
> The ability to use the REST API to manage Dependabot alerts is currently in public preview and subject to change.

## About Dependabot alerts

You can view Dependabot alerts for a repository and update individual alerts with the REST API. For more information, see [Dependabot alerts](/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/dependabot-alerts).

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List Dependabot alerts for an enterprise

```
GET /enterprises/{enterprise}/dependabot/alerts
```

Lists Dependabot alerts for repositories that are owned by the specified enterprise.
The authenticated user must be a member of the enterprise to use this endpoint.
Alerts are only returned for organizations in the enterprise for which you are an organization owner or a security manager. For more information about security managers, see "Managing security managers in your organization."
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the repo or security\_events scope to use this endpoint.

### Parameters

#### Headers

* **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

* **`enterprise`** (string) (required)
  The slug version of the enterprise name.

* **`classification`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of vulnerability classifications. If specified, only alerts for vulnerabilities with these classifications will be returned.
  Can be: malware, general

* **`state`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of states. If specified, only alerts with these states will be returned.
  Can be: auto\_dismissed, dismissed, fixed, open

* **`severity`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of severities. If specified, only alerts with these severities will be returned.
  Can be: low, medium, high, critical

* **`ecosystem`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of ecosystems. If specified, only alerts for these ecosystems will be returned.
  Can be: composer, go, maven, npm, nuget, pip, pub, rubygems, rust

* **`package`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of package names. If specified, only alerts for these packages will be returned.

* **`epss_percentage`** (string)
  CVE Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) percentage. Can be specified as:

An exact number (n)
Comparators such as >n, \<n, >=n, <=n
A range like n..n, where n is a number from 0.0 to 1.0

Filters the list of alerts based on EPSS percentages. If specified, only alerts with the provided EPSS percentages will be returned.

* **`has`** (string)
  Filters the list of alerts based on whether the alert has the given value. If specified, only alerts meeting this criterion will be returned.
  Multiple has filters can be passed to filter for alerts that have all of the values. Currently, only patch is supported.

* **`assignee`** (string)
  Filter alerts by assignees.
  Provide a comma-separated list of user handles (e.g., octocat or octocat,hubot) to return alerts assigned to any of the specified users.
  Use \* to list alerts with at least one assignee or none to list alerts with no assignees.

* **`scope`** (string)
  The scope of the vulnerable dependency. If specified, only alerts with this scope will be returned.
  Can be one of: `development`, `runtime`

* **`relationship`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of relationships of the vulnerable dependency to your project. If specified, only alerts with these relationships will be returned.
  Note

We are rolling out support for dependency relationship across ecosystems. This value will be "unknown" for all dependencies in unsupported ecosystems.

* **`sort`** (string)
  The property by which to sort the results.
  created means when the alert was created.
  updated means when the alert's state last changed.
  epss\_percentage sorts alerts by the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) percentage.
  Default: `created`
  Can be one of: `created`, `updated`, `epss_percentage`

* **`direction`** (string)
  The direction to sort the results by.
  Default: `desc`
  Can be one of: `asc`, `desc`

* **`before`** (string)
  A cursor, as given in the Link header. If specified, the query only searches for results before this cursor. For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."

* **`after`** (string)
  A cursor, as given in the Link header. If specified, the query only searches for results after this cursor. For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."

* **`per_page`** (integer)
  The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."
  Default: `30`

### HTTP response status codes

* **200** - OK

* **304** - Not modified

* **403** - Forbidden

* **404** - Resource not found

* **422** - Validation failed, or the endpoint has been spammed.
