# REST API endpoints for secret scanning

Use the REST API to retrieve and update secret alerts from a repository.

## About secret scanning

You can use the API to:

* Enable or disable secret scanning and push protection for a repository. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for repositories](/en/rest/repos/repos#update-a-repository) and expand the "Properties of the `security_and_analysis` object" section.
* Retrieve and update secret scanning alerts from a repository. For further details, see the sections below.

For more information about secret scanning, see [Secret scanning](/en/code-security/concepts/secret-security/secret-scanning).

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List secret scanning alerts for an organization

```
GET /orgs/{org}/secret-scanning/alerts
```

Lists secret scanning alerts for eligible repositories in an organization, from newest to oldest.
The authenticated user must be an administrator or security manager for the organization to use this endpoint.
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the repo or security\_events scope to use this endpoint. If this endpoint is only used with public repositories, the token can use the public\_repo scope instead.

### Parameters

#### Headers

* **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

* **`org`** (string) (required)
  The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.

* **`state`** (string)
  Set to open or resolved to only list secret scanning alerts in a specific state.
  Can be one of: `open`, `resolved`

* **`secret_type`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of secret types to return. All default secret patterns are returned. To return generic patterns, pass the token name(s) in the parameter. See "Supported secret scanning patterns" for a complete list of secret types.

* **`exclude_secret_types`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of secret types to exclude from the results. All default secret patterns are returned except those matching the specified types. Cannot be combined with the secret\_type parameter. See "Supported secret scanning patterns" for a complete list of secret types.

* **`exclude_providers`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of provider slugs to exclude from the results.
  Provider slugs use lowercase with underscores (e.g., github\_secret\_scanning, clojars).
  You can find the provider slug in the provider\_slug field of each alert.
  Cannot be combined with the providers parameter.

* **`providers`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of provider slugs to filter by.
  Provider slugs use lowercase with underscores (e.g., github\_secret\_scanning, clojars).
  You can find the provider slug in the provider\_slug field of each alert.
  Cannot be combined with the exclude\_providers parameter.

* **`resolution`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of resolutions. Only secret scanning alerts with one of these resolutions are listed. Valid resolutions are false\_positive, wont\_fix, revoked, pattern\_edited, pattern\_deleted or used\_in\_tests.

* **`assignee`** (string)
  Filters alerts by assignee. Use \* to get all assigned alerts, none to get all unassigned alerts, or a GitHub username to get alerts assigned to a specific user.

* **`sort`** (string)
  The property to sort the results by. created means when the alert was created. updated means when the alert was updated or resolved.
  Default: `created`
  Can be one of: `created`, `updated`

* **`direction`** (string)
  The direction to sort the results by.
  Default: `desc`
  Can be one of: `asc`, `desc`

* **`page`** (integer)
  The page number of the results to fetch. For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."
  Default: `1`

* **`per_page`** (integer)
  The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."
  Default: `30`

* **`before`** (string)
  A cursor, as given in the Link header. If specified, the query only searches for events before this cursor. To receive an initial cursor on your first request, include an empty "before" query string.

* **`after`** (string)
  A cursor, as given in the Link header. If specified, the query only searches for events after this cursor.  To receive an initial cursor on your first request, include an empty "after" query string.

* **`validity`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of validities that, when present, will return alerts that match the validities in this list. Valid options are active, inactive, and unknown.

* **`is_publicly_leaked`** (boolean)
  A boolean value representing whether or not to filter alerts by the publicly-leaked tag being present.
  Default: `false`

* **`is_multi_repo`** (boolean)
  A boolean value representing whether or not to filter alerts by the multi-repo tag being present.
  Default: `false`

* **`hide_secret`** (boolean)
  A boolean value representing whether or not to hide literal secrets in the results.
  Default: `false`

* **`is_bypassed`** (boolean)
  A boolean value (true or false) indicating whether to filter alerts by their push protection bypass status. When set to true, only alerts that were created because a push protection rule was bypassed will be returned. When set to false, only alerts that were not caused by a push protection bypass will be returned.

* **`included_metadata`** (string)
  A comma-separated list of metadata fields to filter alerts by. Only alerts that have all of the
  specified metadata fields attached will be returned. Possible values are: owner-email, owner-id,
  owner-name, secret-id, secret-name, secret-issued-date, secret-expiration-date, organization-name,
  organization-id, last-used-date, and has-organization-access.

* **`owner_email_hash`** (string)
  Filters alerts to only those whose attached owner\_email metadata field matches the
  provided value. The value must be the lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the email
  address to match (for example, the SHA-256 of <user@example.com>). Only alerts that
  have an owner\_email metadata value whose SHA-256 hash equals this parameter are
  returned.

## Update a secret scanning alert

```
PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/secret-scanning/alerts/{alert_number}
```

Updates the status of a secret scanning alert in an eligible repository.
You can also use this endpoint to assign or unassign an alert to a user who has write access to the repository.
The authenticated user must be an administrator for the repository or for the organization that owns the repository to use this endpoint.
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the repo or security\_events scope to use this endpoint. If this endpoint is only used with public repositories, the token can use the public\_repo scope instead.

  An optional comment when closing or reopening an alert. Cannot be updated or deleted.

* **`assignee`** (string or null)
  The username of the user to assign to the alert. Set to null to unassign the alert.

* **`validity`** (string or null)
  Sets the validity of the secret scanning alert. Can be active, inactive, or null to clear the override.
