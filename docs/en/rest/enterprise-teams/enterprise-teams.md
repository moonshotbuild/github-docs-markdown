# REST API endpoints for enterprise teams

Use the REST API to create and manage enterprise teams in your GitHub enterprise.

## About enterprise teams

These endpoints are only available to authenticated members of the enterprise team's enterprise with classic personal access tokens with the `read:enterprise` [scope](/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps) for `GET` APIs and `admin:enterprise` for other APIs.

These endpoints are not compatible with fine-grained personal access tokens or GitHub App access tokens.

GitHub generates the enterprise team's `slug` from the team `name` and adds the `ent:` prefix.

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.
