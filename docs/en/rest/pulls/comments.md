# REST API endpoints for pull request review comments

Use the REST API to interact with pull request review comments.

## About pull request review comments

Pull request review comments are comments made on a portion of the unified diff during a pull request review. These are different from commit comments and issue comments in a pull request. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for commit comments](/en/rest/commits/comments) and [REST API endpoints for issue comments](/en/rest/issues/comments).

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List review comments in a repository

* **`start_side`** (string)
  Required when using multi-line comments unless using in\_reply\_to. The start\_side is the starting side of the diff that the comment applies to. Can be LEFT or RIGHT. To learn more about multi-line comments, see "Commenting on a pull request" in the GitHub Help documentation. See side in this table for additional context.
  Can be one of: `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `side`

* **`in_reply_to`** (integer)
  The ID of the review comment to reply to. To find the ID of a review comment with "List review comments on a pull request". When specified, all parameters other than body in the request body are ignored.
