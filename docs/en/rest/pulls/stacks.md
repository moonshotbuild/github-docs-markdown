# REST API endpoints for stacked pull requests

Use the REST API to interact with stacked pull requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List pull request stacks

```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stacks
```

Lists pull request stacks in a repository.

### Parameters

#### Headers

- **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

- **`owner`** (string) (required)
  The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.

- **`repo`** (string) (required)
  The name of the repository without the .git extension. The name is not case sensitive.

- **`pull_request`** (integer)
  Filter to the stack containing this repository pull request number.

- **`per_page`** (integer)
  The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."
  Default: `30`

- **`page`** (integer)

```
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stacks
```

Creates a stack from an ordered list of pull request numbers. Provide the pull
request numbers from the bottom of the stack to the top. Each pull request's
base ref must match the previous pull request's head ref.

## Remove pull requests from a pull request stack

```
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stacks/{stack_number}/unstack
