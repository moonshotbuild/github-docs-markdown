# REST API endpoints for pull request reviews

Use the REST API to interact with pull request reviews.

## About pull request reviews

Pull Request Reviews are groups of pull request review comments on a pull request, grouped together with a state and optional body comment.

> [!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List reviews for a pull request

```

## Create a review for a pull request

```
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews
```

Creates a review on a specified pull request.
This endpoint triggers notifications. Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more information, see "Rate limits for the API" and "Best practices for using the REST API."
Pull request reviews created in the PENDING state are not submitted and therefore do not include the submitted_at property in the response. To create a pending review for a pull request, leave the event parameter blank. For more information about submitting a PENDING review, see "Submit a review for a pull request."
Note

To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to first determine the position of that line in the diff. To see a pull request diff, add the application/vnd.github.v3.diff media type to the Accept header of a call to the Get a pull request endpoint.

The position value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.
This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github-commitcomment.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github-commitcomment.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github-commitcomment.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github-commitcomment.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

- **`pull_number`** (integer) (required)
  The number that identifies the pull request.

#### Body parameters

- **`commit_id`** (string)
  The SHA of the commit that needs a review. Not using the latest commit SHA may render your review comment outdated if a subsequent commit modifies the line you specify as the position. Defaults to the most recent commit in the pull request when you do not specify a value.

- **`body`** (string)
  Required when using REQUEST_CHANGES or COMMENT for the event parameter. The body text of the pull request review.

- **`event`** (string)

  Use the following table to specify the location, destination, and contents of the draft review comment.

The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.
