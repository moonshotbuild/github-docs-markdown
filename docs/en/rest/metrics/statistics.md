# REST API endpoints for repository statistics

Use the REST API to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.

## About repository statistics

You can use the REST API to fetch the data that GitHub uses for visualizing different types of repository activity.

### Best practices for caching

Computing repository statistics is an expensive operation, so we try to return cached
data whenever possible. If the data hasn't been cached when you query a repository's
statistics, you'll receive a `202` response; a background job is also fired to
start compiling these statistics. You should allow the job a short time to complete, and
then submit the request again. If the job has completed, that request will receive a
`200` response with the statistics in the response body.

Repository statistics are cached by the SHA of the repository's default branch; pushing to the default branch resets the statistics cache.

### Statistics exclude some types of commits

The statistics exposed by the API match the statistics shown by [different repository graphs](/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/about-repository-graphs).

To summarize this:

* All statistics exclude merge commits.
* Contributor statistics also exclude empty commits.

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## Get the weekly commit activity

```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/code_frequency
```

Returns a weekly aggregate of the number of additions and deletions pushed to a repository.
Note

This endpoint can only be used for repositories with fewer than 10,000 commits. If the repository contains 10,000 or more commits, a 422 status code will be returned.

### HTTP response status codes

* **200** - Returns a weekly aggregate of the number of additions and deletions pushed to a repository.
