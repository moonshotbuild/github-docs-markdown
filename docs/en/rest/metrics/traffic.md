# REST API endpoints for repository traffic

Use the REST API to retrieve information provided in your repository graph.

## About repository traffic

You can use these endpoints to retrieve information provided in your repository graph, for repositories that you have write access to. For more information, see [Viewing traffic to a repository](/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/viewing-traffic-to-a-repository).
