# REST API endpoints for community metrics

Use the REST API to retrieve information about your community profile.

> [!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## Get community profile metrics

```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/community/profile
```

Returns all community profile metrics for a repository. The repository cannot be a fork.
The returned metrics include an overall health score, the repository description, the presence of documentation, the
detected code of conduct, the detected license, and the presence of ISSUE_TEMPLATE, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE,
README, and CONTRIBUTING files.
The health_percentage score is defined as a percentage of how many of
the recommended community health files are present. For more information, see
"About community profiles for public repositories."
content_reports_enabled is only returned for organization-owned repositories.

### Parameters
