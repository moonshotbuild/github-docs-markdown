# REST API endpoints for emails

Use the REST API to manage email addresses of authenticated users.

## About email administration

If a request URL does not include a `{username}` parameter then the response will be for the signed-in user (and you must pass [authentication information](/en/rest/authentication/authenticating-to-the-rest-api) with your request). Additional private information, such as whether a user has two-factor authentication enabled, is included when authenticated through OAuth with the `user` scope.

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## Set primary email visibility for the authenticated user

```
PATCH /user/email/visibility
```

Sets the visibility for your primary email addresses.

### Parameters

### HTTP response status codes

* **200** - OK

* **304** - Not modified
