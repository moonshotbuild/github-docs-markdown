# REST API endpoints for protection rules

Use the REST API to create, configure, and delete deployment protection rules.

> [!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## Get all deployment protection rules for an environment

```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/environments/{environment_name}/deployment_protection_rules
```

Gets all custom deployment protection rules that are enabled for an environment. Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint. For more information about environments, see "Using environments for deployment."
For more information about the app that is providing this custom deployment rule, see the documentation for the GET /apps/{app_slug} endpoint.
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the repo scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.
