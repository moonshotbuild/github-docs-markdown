# REST API endpoints for GitHub Actions artifacts

Use the REST API to interact with artifacts in GitHub Actions.

## About artifacts in GitHub Actions

You can use the REST API to download, delete, and retrieve information about workflow artifacts in GitHub Actions. Artifacts enable you to share data between jobs in a workflow and store data once that workflow has completed. For more information, see [Store and share data with workflow artifacts](/en/actions/tutorials/store-and-share-data).

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.

## List artifacts for a repository

```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/artifacts
```

Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint.
OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the repo scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.
