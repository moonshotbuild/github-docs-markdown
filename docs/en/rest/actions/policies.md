## Update a repository Actions policy

```
PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/policies/{policy_id}
```

Update an Actions policy for a repository.
Omitting workflow_path preserves the policy's existing workflow targeting.

### Parameters

#### Headers

- **`accept`** (string)
  Setting to `application/vnd.github+json` is recommended.

#### Path and query parameters

- **`owner`** (string) (required)
  The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.

- **`repo`** (string) (required)
  The name of the repository without the .git extension. The name is not case sensitive.

- **`policy_id`** (integer) (required)
  The ID of the policy.

#### Body parameters

- **`name`** (string)
  The name of the policy.

- **`enforcement`** (string)
  The enforcement level of the ruleset. evaluate allows admins to test rules before enforcing them. Admins can view insights on the Rule Insights page (evaluate is only available with GitHub Enterprise).
  Can be one of: `disabled`, `active`, `evaluate`

- **`conditions`** (object)
  Conditions for a repository Actions policy. The object may be empty to preserve or use the
default workflow targeting, or contain only workflow_path.
  - **``** (object)
  - **`Actions policy workflow path condition`** (object)
    Parameters for an Actions policy workflow path condition. Omitting workflow_path when creating
a policy targets all workflows without storing an explicit condition. Omitting it when updating a
policy preserves the existing workflow targeting. For new or changed workflow conditions, the API
requires at least one included or excluded pattern. This is validated server-side rather than by
this schema, which can also describe existing stored conditions.
    - **`workflow_path`** (object) (required)
      - **`include`** (array of strings) (required)
        Array of workflow file paths or glob patterns to include. An empty array includes all
workflows not matched by an excluded pattern. Use ~ALL by itself to include all workflows.
~ALL cannot be combined with other included patterns.
      - **`exclude`** (array of strings) (required)
        Array of workflow file paths or glob patterns to exclude. The condition will not pass
if any of these patterns match. ~ALL is not allowed in this array.

- **`rules`** (array of objects)
  An array of rules within the policy.
  - **`restrict_actions_actors`** (object)
    Choose specific actors that are authorized to trigger Actions workflows.
    - **`type`** (string) (required)
      Can be one of: `restrict_actions_actors`
    - **`parameters`** (object)
      - **`allowed_actors`** (array of objects) (required)
        Select the actors who can run Actions workflows.
        - **`id`** (integer) (required)
          ID of the actor authorized to trigger Actions workflows.
        - **`type`** (string) (required)
          The type of the actor
          Can be one of: `User`, `Bot`, `Team`, `BusinessTeam`, `EnterpriseTeam`, `IntegrationInstallation`, `App`, `RepositoryRole`
  - **`restrict_action_events`** (object)
    Choose specific GitHub events that will trigger Actions workflows.
    - **`type`** (string) (required)
      Can be one of: `restrict_action_events`
    - **`parameters`** (object)
      - **`allowed_events`** (array of strings) (required)
        Select the events that can trigger Actions workflows.
Supported values are: branch_protection_rule, check_run, check_suite, create, delete, deployment, deployment_status, discussion, discussion_comment, fork, gollum, image_version, issue_comment, issues, label, merge_group, milestone, page_build, project, project_card, project_column, public, pull_request, pull_request_review, pull_request_review_comment, pull_request_target, push, registry_package, release, repository_dispatch, schedule, status, watch, workflow_call, workflow_dispatch, workflow_run
