# Viewing usage for your GitHub Enterprise plan

Learn how to display the number of users in your enterprise. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud full billing information is also available.

## Viewing subscription and usage for your enterprise

You can view the subscription and usage for your enterprise and download a file with license details.

1. Navigate to your enterprise. For example, from the [Enterprises](https://github.com/settings/enterprises?ref_product=ghec\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text) page on GitHub.com.
2. At the top of the page, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-credit-card" aria-label="credit-card" role="img"><path d="M10.75 9a.75.75 0 0 0 0 1.5h1.5a.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5h-1.5Z"></path><path d="M0 3.75C0 2.784.784 2 1.75 2h12.5c.966 0 1.75.784 1.75 1.75v8.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 14.25 14H1.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 0 12.25ZM14.5 6.5h-13v5.75c0 .138.112.25.25.25h12.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25Zm0-2.75a.25.25 0 0 0-.25-.25H1.75a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25V5h13Z"></path></svg> Billing and licensing**.
3. Click **Licensing** to show detailed information on license use.

The information displayed varies according to your enterprise set up.

* GitHub Enterprise Cloud, potentially with licenses synchronized from GitHub Enterprise Server
* GitHub Enterprise Server

To learn more about the license data associated with your enterprise account and how the number of consumed user licenses is calculated, see [Troubleshooting license usage for GitHub Enterprise](/en/billing/how-tos/troubleshooting/enterprise-license-usage).

## Finding information on GitHub Enterprise Cloud

On the "Licensing" page, the number of consumed licenses is shown under "Enterprise Cloud". In addition, you can see:

* Usage-based billing: the estimated monthly payment, assuming no further license changes
* Volume billing: your total available licenses and your subscription expiration date.

### Viewing more detailed information

* To view details of license usage, to the right of "Enterprise Cloud", click **More details**.
* To download a CSV file with license details, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-download" aria-label="download" role="img"><path d="M2.75 14A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 1 12.25v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0v2.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h10.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0v2.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 13.25 14Z"></path><path d="M7.25 7.689V2a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0v5.689l1.97-1.969a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06 1.06l-3.25 3.25a.749.749 0 0 1-1.06 0L4.22 6.78a.749.749 0 1 1 1.06-1.06l1.97 1.969Z"></path></svg> Download CSV report**.

### Viewing history of changes to license usage

> \[!NOTE]
> This feature is in public preview and only available to usage-based enterprise accounts without Visual Studio bundles.

To view the history of license usage over time, on the "Licensing" page, to the right of "Enterprise Cloud", click **Manage**.

The license history starts capturing history from the day the feature is enabled on your account, and provides a daily snapshot of license additions and removals for GitHub Enterprise Cloud. This information shows you how licenses are being consumed and why billed amounts change.

The license history shows:

* Daily snapshot of licenses so you can monitor usage over time
* Actor(s) that added or removed each license to provide accountability
* Date on which the license addition or removal was performed
* Effective date for when the license additions and removals will affect your monthly bill

### Synchronization of GitHub Enterprise Server use

The date of the last license sync occurred is shown under "Enterprise Server instances". Look for timestamps next to usage uploaded or synced events.

* "Server usage uploaded" indicates license usage between environments was manually updated when a GitHub Enterprise Server license file was uploaded.
* "GitHub Connect server usage synced" indicates license usage between environments was automatically updated.
* "GitHub Connect server usage never synced" indicates that GitHub Connect is configured, but license usage between environments has never updated successfully.

For more information, see [Syncing license usage from GitHub Enterprise Server to Cloud](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/how-tos/manage-server-licenses/sync-license-usage).

### Synchronization of Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise subscriptions

If your GitHub license includes Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise, you can identify whether a user account on GitHub Enterprise Cloud has successfully matched with a Visual Studio subscriber by downloading the CSV file that contains additional license details. The license status will be one of the following:

* "Matched": The user account on GitHub.com is linked with a Visual Studio subscriber.
* "Pending Invitation": An invitation was sent to a Visual Studio subscriber, but the subscriber has not accepted the invitation.
* Blank: There is no Visual Studio association to consider for the user account on GitHub.com.

## Finding information on GitHub Enterprise Server

* Under "User licenses", view your total licenses, number of consumed licenses, and your subscription expiration date.
* To view details for license usage or download a JSON file with license details, click **View users** or **Export license usage**.
* Review your current GitHub Enterprise license, as well as consumed and available user licenses.

## Reporting license information using the REST API

You can also use the REST API to return consumed licenses data and the status of the license sync job. See [Licensing](/en/rest/enterprise-admin/licensing).
