# Combined GitHub Enterprise cloud and server use

Your enterprise account enables you to set up GitHub Enterprise Server with no additional cost.

## About enterprise deployments

GitHub Enterprise offers two deployment options. In addition to GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you can use GitHub Enterprise Server to host development work for your enterprise in your data center or a supported cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's plans](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans#github-enterprise).

If you use both GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server, you'll have **an enterprise account for each.** Even if you **only** use GitHub Enterprise Server, we recommend creating an enterprise account on GitHub Enterprise Cloud. This will make it easier to contact GitHub Enterprise Support and share support bundles with them. To create an additional enterprise account, contact [GitHub's Sales team](https://enterprise.github.com/contact).

For most administration options, such as policies, you will manage each enterprise account separately. However, you can use the enterprise account on GitHub Enterprise Cloud to view all license usage across all deployments.

## About licensing for GitHub Enterprise

GitHub uses a unique-user licensing model. With the GitHub Enterprise plan, you're entitled to use both GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. Your GitHub Enterprise Cloud allowance includes **one** deployment, on either GitHub.com or GHE.com.

GitHub determines how many licensed seats you're consuming based on the number of unique users across your deployments. Each user only consumes one license, no matter how many GitHub Enterprise Server instances the user uses, or how many organizations the user is a member of on your GitHub Enterprise Cloud deployment. This model allows each person to use multiple GitHub Enterprise deployments without incurring extra costs.

To use a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, you must upload a license file that GitHub provides. See [License files for GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/billing/concepts/enterprise-billing/ghes-license-files).

## Syncing licenses

For a person using multiple GitHub Enterprise environments to only consume a single license, you must synchronize license usage between environments. Then, GitHub will deduplicate users based on the email addresses associated with their user accounts. GitHub deduplicates licenses for the GitHub Enterprise plan itself, and for GitHub Advanced Security products. See [Syncing license usage from GitHub Enterprise Server to Cloud](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/how-tos/manage-server-licenses/sync-license-usage).

## Usage-based and volume licensing

There are two types of GitHub Enterprise (GHE) licensing models, with different processes for enabling combined use of GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server.

* **GHE (Usage-based, also called metered)**: A cloud-first license where users must first be assigned to a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization.
  * All Cloud users automatically receive a right to use GitHub Enterprise Server.
  * Billing is based on the number of active users each month.
  * Users can generate their own Server license, and the seat count is based on the number of consumed enterprise Cloud licenses at the time of generation. The license is valid for one year.

    You can find your enterprise's consumed Cloud license count on your enterprise's **Billing & Licensing > Licensing** page. Do **not** use the "Total consumed" licenses count on the **People > Members** page: that number will be higher than the Cloud-only count used for license generation.
  * Server-only users will be added to GHE (Metered) billing. These users are de-duplicated with email matching to avoid double billing.

* **GHE (Volume/Subscription, also called GHE Unified)**: A bundled license for both GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server.
  * One license covers both GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing users to work in either or both.
  * Users can access both services via GitHub Connect.
  * This license requires manual setup and is provided by GitHub Sales.

> \[!NOTE] If you currently pay for your GitHub Enterprise licenses through a volume, subscription, or prepaid agreement, you will continue to be billed in this way until your agreement expires or you are invited to transition. At renewal, you have the option to switch to the metered billing model.
