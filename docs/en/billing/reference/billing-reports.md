# Billing reports reference

Billing reports show detailed GitHub usage, AI credits consumption, and billing information for your account.

Usage reports show detailed information about your account’s GitHub usage, including how much of each SKU was used and the resulting billable amount.

To generate a usage report, see [Viewing your usage of metered products and licenses](/en/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use#downloading-usage-reports).

## Report types

The following report types are available.

* Metered usage page:
  * **Summarized usage report**: A summary of usage for all paid products for a maximum period of one year.
  * **Detailed usage report**: A detailed usage report for all paid products for a maximum period of 31 days.
* AI usage page:
  * **AI usage report**: A detailed per-user breakdown of AI credits consumed for a maximum period of 31 days.

### Summarized usage report

This report sums the `quantity`, `gross_amount`, `discount_amount`, and `net_amount` fields based on the combination of the following values: `date`, `sku`, `repository`, `cost_center_name`. If the usage report is for an enterprise with organizations, the amounts will be summarized by the organization value as well.

### Detailed usage report

The detailed usage report includes the same fields as the summarized report and adds `username` and `workflow_path`.

This report sums the `quantity`, `gross_amount`, `discount_amount`, and `net_amount` fields based on the combination of the following values:  `date`, `sku`, `organization`, `repository`, `cost_center_name`, `username`, `workflow_path`.

> \[!NOTE] Data for the detailed usage report is available only through the GitHub web interface and cannot be obtained via the REST API `/usage` endpoint. The REST API only provides access to summarized billing information.

### AI usage report

This report includes additional detail about AI credits consumption. The report sums the `quantity`, `gross_amount`, `discount_amount`, and `net_amount` fields based on the combination of the following values: `date`, `model`, `username`. For each model, the report also breaks down token usage into the `input`, `output`, `cache_read`, and `cache_write` fields, so you can see the token detail behind each model's AI credits consumption.

## Usage report fields

The usage reports contain the following fields.

## Receiving the report

Usage reports are sent via email to the default email address associated with your GitHub account. You can only request one usage report per account at a time.

## Metered usage report fields that have closed down

GitHub aims to minimize changes to the usage report structure, however at times the report structure or fields may change.

The following fields have been removed from the usage reports.

| Field           | Replacement                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `usage_at`      | Refer to `date` instead.          |
| `workflow_name` | Refer to `workflow_path` instead. |
