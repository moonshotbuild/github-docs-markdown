# Dependabot errors

Dependabot automatically maintains your dependencies, keeping your code secure and current. This reference helps you diagnose and resolve issues so automated updates can continue.

When Dependabot encounters errors while updating your dependencies, you can use this reference to diagnose and fix common problems.

## How to view errors

### Security update errors

When Dependabot is blocked from creating a pull request to fix a Dependabot alert, it posts the error message on the alert. The Dependabot alerts view shows a list of any alerts that have not been resolved yet. To access the alerts view, click **Dependabot alerts** on the **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-shield" aria-label="shield" role="img"><path d="M7.467.133a1.748 1.748 0 0 1 1.066 0l5.25 1.68A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 15 3.48V7c0 1.566-.32 3.182-1.303 4.682-.983 1.498-2.585 2.813-5.032 3.855a1.697 1.697 0 0 1-1.33 0c-2.447-1.042-4.049-2.357-5.032-3.855C1.32 10.182 1 8.566 1 7V3.48a1.75 1.75 0 0 1 1.217-1.667Zm.61 1.429a.25.25 0 0 0-.153 0l-5.25 1.68a.25.25 0 0 0-.174.238V7c0 1.358.275 2.666 1.057 3.86.784 1.194 2.121 2.34 4.366 3.297a.196.196 0 0 0 .154 0c2.245-.956 3.582-2.104 4.366-3.298C13.225 9.666 13.5 8.36 13.5 7V3.48a.251.251 0 0 0-.174-.237l-5.25-1.68ZM8.75 4.75v3a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-3a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 10.5a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z"></path></svg> Security and quality** tab for the repository. Where a pull request that will fix the vulnerable dependency has been generated, the alert includes a link to that pull request.

![Screenshot of the Dependabot alerts view. To the right of one alert, a link to a pull request, titled "#353," is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/dependabot/dependabot-alert-pr-link.png)

An alert may have no pull request link for several reasons:

1. Dependabot security updates are not enabled for the repository.
2. The alert is for an indirect or transitive dependency that is not explicitly defined in a lock file.
3. An error blocked Dependabot from creating a pull request.

To view error details, click the alert.

### Version update errors

When Dependabot is blocked from creating a pull request to update a dependency in an ecosystem, you can view the job logs list to find out more about the error.

The job logs list is accessible from the dependency graph of a repository. From the dependency graph, click the **Dependabot** tab, then to the right of the affected manifest file, click **Recent update jobs**.

To view the full log files for a particular job, to the right of the log entry you are interested in, click **view logs**.

![Screenshot of the Dependabot job log entries for a manifest file. A button, called "View logs," is highlighted in a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/dependabot/dependabot-job-log-error-message.png)

For more information, see [Viewing Dependabot job logs](/en/code-security/how-tos/view-and-interpret-data/view-dependabot-logs).

## Dependency resolution errors

### Cannot update DEPENDENCY to a non-vulnerable version

**Applies to:** Security updates only

**Error message:** `Dependabot cannot update DEPENDENCY to a non-vulnerable version`

Dependabot cannot create a pull request to update the vulnerable dependency to a secure version without breaking other dependencies in the dependency graph for this repository.

Every application that has dependencies has a dependency graph, that is, a directed acyclic graph of every package version that the application directly or indirectly depends on. Every time a dependency is updated, this graph must resolve otherwise the application won't build. When an ecosystem has a deep and complex dependency graph, for example, npm and RubyGems, it is often impossible to upgrade a single dependency without upgrading the whole ecosystem.

**Resolution:** Stay up to date with the most recently released versions, for example, by enabling version updates. This increases the likelihood that a vulnerability in one dependency can be resolved by a simple upgrade that doesn't break the dependency graph. See [Configuring Dependabot version updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/secure-your-dependencies/configure-version-updates).

### Updates dependencies without an alert

**Applies to:** Security updates only

**Error message:** `Dependabot tries to update dependencies without an alert`

Dependabot updates explicitly defined transitive dependencies that are vulnerable for all ecosystems. For npm, Dependabot will raise a pull request that also updates the parent dependency if it's the only way to fix the transitive dependency.

For example, a project with a dependency on `A` version `~2.0.0` which has a transitive dependency on `B` version `~1.0.0` which has resolved to `1.0.1`.

```shell
my project
|
--> A (2.0.0) [~2.0.0]
       |
       --> B (1.0.1) [~1.0.0]
```

If a security vulnerability is released for `B` versions `<2.0.0` and a patch is available at `2.0.0` then Dependabot will attempt to update `B` but will find that it's not possible due to the restriction in place by `A` which only allows lower vulnerable versions. To fix the vulnerability, Dependabot will look for updates to dependency `A` which allow the fixed version of `B` to be used.

Dependabot automatically generates a pull request that upgrades both the locked parent and child transitive dependencies.

### Can't close pull request for an update that's already been applied

**Error message:** `Dependabot fails to close a open pull request for an update that has already been applied on the default branch`

Dependabot will close pull requests for dependency updates, once it detects these updates have been committed to the default branch. However, in rare circumstances, the pull request may remain open.

**Resolution:** If you notice that you have committed an update to a dependency manually, and that the pull request for that same update is still open, you can use one of the following commands in a comment on the pull request:

* `@dependabot recreate`, or
* `@dependabot rebase`.

Either comment will trigger Dependabot to check if the dependency is no longer upgradable or vulnerable. If Dependabot detects that the pull request is no longer required, it will close the pull request in this particular case.

For more information about Dependabot comment commands, see [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/manage-dependabot-prs#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands).

### Can't update to the required version as there is already an open pull request for the latest version

**Applies to:** Security updates only

**Error message:** `Dependabot cannot update to the required version as there is already an open pull request for the latest version`

Dependabot will not create a pull request to update the vulnerable dependency to a secure version because there is already an open pull request to update this dependency. You will see this error when a vulnerability is detected in a single dependency and there's already an open pull request to update the dependency to the latest version.

**Resolution:** You can review the open pull request and merge it as soon as you are confident that the change is safe, or close that pull request and trigger a new security update pull request. See [Triggering a Dependabot pull request manually](#triggering-a-dependabot-pull-request-manually).

### No security update needed

**Applies to:** Security updates only

**Error message:** `No security update is needed as DEPENDENCY is no longer vulnerable`

Dependabot cannot close a pull request to update a dependency that is not, or is no longer, vulnerable. You may see this error when dependency graph data is stale, or when the dependency graph and Dependabot do not agree if a particular version of a dependency is vulnerable.

**Resolution:** First examine the dependency graph for your repository, review what version it has detected for the dependency, and check if the identified version matches what is being used in your repository.

If you suspect your dependency graph data is out of date, you may need to manually update the dependency graph for your repository or investigate your dependency information further. See [Troubleshooting the dependency graph](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/troubleshoot-dependabot/dependency-graph-errors).

If you are able to confirm the dependency version is no longer vulnerable, you can close the Dependabot pull request.

## Pull request errors

### Pull request limit reached

**Error message:** `Dependabot cannot open any more pull requests`

There's a limit on the number of open pull requests Dependabot will generate. When this limit is reached, no new pull requests are opened and this error is reported.

**Limits:**

* Security update pull requests: 10
* Version update pull requests: 5 (configurable using `open-pull-requests-limit`)

There are separate limits for security and version update pull requests, so that open version update pull requests cannot block the creation of a security update pull request. For more information, see [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#open-pull-requests-limit-).

**Resolution:** Merge or close some of the existing pull requests and trigger a new pull request manually. see [Triggering a Dependabot pull request manually](#triggering-a-dependabot-pull-request-manually).

## Timeout and performance errors

### Update timed out

**Error message:** `Dependabot timed out during its update`

Dependabot took longer than the maximum time allowed to assess the update required and prepare a pull request. This error is usually seen only for large repositories with many manifest files, for example, npm or yarn monorepo projects with hundreds of *package.json* files. Updates to the Composer ecosystem also take longer to assess and may time out.

**Resolution for version updates:** Specify the most important dependencies to update using the `allow` parameter or, alternatively, use the `ignore` parameter to exclude some dependencies from updates. Updating your configuration might allow Dependabot to review the version update and generate the pull request in the time available.

**Resolution for security updates:** Reduce the chances of timeouts by keeping the dependencies updated, for example, by enabling version updates. For more information, see [Configuring Dependabot version updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/secure-your-dependencies/configure-version-updates).

## Grouping errors

### Failed to group dependencies (version updates)

**Applies to:** Version updates only

**Error message:** `Dependabot fails to group a set of dependencies into a single pull request for Dependabot version updates`

The [`groups`](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#groups--) configuration settings in the `dependabot.yml` file can apply to version updates and security updates. Use the `applies-to` key to specify where (version updates or security updates) a set of grouping rules is applied.

You cannot apply a single grouping set of rules to both *version* updates and *security* updates. Instead, if you want to group both version updates and security updates using the same criteria, you must define two, separately named, grouping sets of rules.

When you configure grouped version updates, you must configure groups per package ecosystem.

**Common cause - empty groups:** You may have unintentionally created empty groups. This happens, for example, when you set a `dependency-type` in the `allow` key for the overall job.

```yaml copy
allow:
  dependency-type: production
  # this restricts the entire job to production dependencies
  groups:
      development-dependencies:
        dependency-type: "development"
        # this group will always be empty
```

In this example, Dependabot will:

1. Look at your dependency list and restrict the job to dependencies used in `production` only.
2. Try to create a group called `development-dependencies` which is a subset of this reduced list.
3. Work out that the `development-dependencies` group is empty as all `development` dependencies were removed in step 1.
4. **Individually** update all the dependencies that are not in the group. As the group for dependencies in production is empty, Dependabot will ignore the group, and create a separate pull request for each dependency.

**Resolution:** Ensure that configuration settings don't cancel each other, and update them appropriately in your configuration file. To debug the problem, look at the logs. For information about accessing the logs for a manifest, see [How to view errors](#how-to-view-errors).

For more information on how to configure groups for Dependabot version updates, see [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#groups--).

### Failed to group dependencies (security updates)

**Applies to:** Security updates only

**Error message:** `Dependabot fails to group a set of dependencies into a single pull request for Dependabot security updates`

The [`groups`](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#groups--) configuration settings in the `dependabot.yml` file can apply to version updates and security updates. Use the `applies-to` key to specify where (version updates or security updates) a set of grouping rules is applied. Check you have grouping configured to apply to security updates. If the `applies-to` key is absent from a set of grouping rules in your configuration, any group rules will by default only apply to version updates.

You cannot apply a single grouping set of rules to both *version* updates and *security* updates. Instead, if you want to group both version updates and security updates using the same criteria, you must define two, separately named, grouping sets of rules.

**Grouping guidelines for security updates:**

* Dependabot **will** group dependencies from the same package ecosystem that are located in different directories when grouping rules are specified for configurations that use the `directories` key.
* Dependabot **will** apply other relevant customization options from the `dependabot.yml` file to pull requests for grouped security updates. Group rules configured in a `dependabot.yml` file will override the user interface settings for enabling or disabling grouped security updates at the organization or repository level.
* Dependabot **will not** group dependencies from different package ecosystems together.
* Dependabot **will not** group security updates with version updates.

For more information, see [Dependabot security updates](/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/dependabot-security-updates#about-grouped-security-updates) and [Customizing pull requests for Dependabot security updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/customizing-dependabot-security-prs).

### Failed to update dependency in grouped pull request

**Error message:** `Dependabot fails to update one of the dependencies in a grouped pull request`

There are different troubleshooting techniques you can use for failed version updates and failed security updates.

#### Version updates

**Applies to:** Version updates only

Dependabot will show the failed update in your logs, as well as in the job summary at the end of your logs.

**Resolution:**

1. Use the `@dependabot recreate` comment on the pull request to build the group again. See [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/manage-dependabot-prs#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands).
2. If the dependency still fails to update, use the `exclude-patterns` configuration so that the dependency is excluded from the group. Dependabot will then raise a separate pull request to update the dependency.
3. If the dependency still fails to update, there may be a problem with the dependency itself, or with Dependabot for that specific ecosystem.

If you want to ignore updates for the dependency, you must do one of the following.

* Configure an `ignore` rule for the dependency in the `dependabot.yml` file. For more information, see [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#ignore--).
* Use the `@dependabot ignore` comment command for the dependency in the pull request for the grouped updates. For more information, see [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/manage-dependabot-prs#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands).

#### Security updates

**Applies to:** Security updates only

If a grouped pull request for security updates fails or is unable to be merged, manually open pull requests to bump the versions of breaking changes. When you manually update a package that is included in a grouped pull request, Dependabot will rebase the pull request so it does not include the manually updated package.

If you want to ignore updates for the dependency, you must do one of the following.

* Configure an `ignore` rule for the dependency in the `dependabot.yml` file. For more information, see [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#ignore--).
* Use the `@dependabot ignore` comment command for the dependency in the pull request for the grouped updates. For more information, see [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/manage-dependabot-prs#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands).

### Continuous integration fails on grouped pull request

**Applies to:** Version updates only

**Error message:** `Continuous integration (CI) fails on my grouped pull request`

**Resolution:**

If the failure is due to a single dependency, use the `exclude-patterns` configuration so that the dependency is excluded from the group. Dependabot will then raise a separate pull request to update the dependency.

If you want to ignore updates for the dependency, you must do one of the following.

* Configure an `ignore` rule for the dependency in the `dependabot.yml` file. For more information, see [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#ignore--).
* Use the `@dependabot ignore` comment command for the dependency in the pull request for the grouped updates. For more information, see [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/manage-dependabot-prs#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands).

If you continue to see CI failures, remove the group configuration so that Dependabot reverts to raising individual pull requests for each dependency. Then, check and confirm that the update works correctly for each individual pull request.

## Authentication and registry errors

### Cannot resolve or access dependencies

**Error message:** `Dependabot can't resolve your LANGUAGE dependency files`

**API error type:** `git_dependencies_not_reachable`

If Dependabot attempts to check whether dependency references need to be updated in a repository, but can't access one or more of the referenced files, the operation will fail.

### Private package registry errors

Dependabot may generate one of the following errors when it can't access a private package registry:

| Error message                                                                 | API error type                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "Dependabot can't reach a dependency in a private package registry"           | `private_source_not_reachable`          |
| "Dependabot can't authenticate to a private package registry"                 | `private_source_authentication_failure` |
| "Dependabot timed out while waiting for a private package registry"           | `private_source_timed_out`              |
| "Dependabot couldn't validate the certificate for a private package registry" | `private_source_certificate_failure`    |

**Resolution:** Make sure that all of the referenced dependencies are hosted at accessible locations.

**Version updates only:** When running security or version updates, some ecosystems must be able to resolve all dependencies from their source to verify that updates have been successful. If your manifest or lock files contain any private dependencies, Dependabot must be able to access the location at which those dependencies are hosted. Organization owners can grant Dependabot access to private repositories containing dependencies for a project within the same organization. For more information, see [Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#allowing-dependabot-to-access-private-dependencies). You can configure access to private registries in a repository's `dependabot.yml` configuration file. For more information, see [Configuring access to private registries for Dependabot](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/configure-access-to-private-registries). Additionally, Dependabot doesn't support private GitHub dependencies for all package managers. See [Dependabot supported ecosystems and repositories](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/supported-ecosystems-and-repositories).

## Triggering a Dependabot pull request manually

If you unblock Dependabot, you can manually trigger a fresh attempt to create a pull request.

**For security updates:** Display the Dependabot alert that shows the error you have fixed and click **Create Dependabot security update**.

**For version updates:** On the **Insights** tab for the repository click **Dependency graph**, and then click the **Dependabot** tab. Click **Last checked *TIME* ago** to see the log file that Dependabot generated during the last check for version updates. Click **Check for updates**.
