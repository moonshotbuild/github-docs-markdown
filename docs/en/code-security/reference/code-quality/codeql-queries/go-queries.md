# Go CodeQL queries for Code Quality

Explore the queries that CodeQL uses to analyze code quality for code written in Go.

Code Quality uses the following CodeQL queries to analyze Go code and detect code quality issues on:

* Your **default branch**, with results shown on the repository's "Standard findings" dashboard
* **Pull requests**, with findings shown as comments made by `github-code-quality[bot]`

Copilot Autofix suggestions are provided for findings where possible.
