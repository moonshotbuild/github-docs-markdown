> \[!NOTE]
> To ensure a consistent and responsive experience, for organization members, the organization-level security overview pages will only display results from the most recently updated 3,000 repositories. If your results have been restricted, a notification will appear at the top of the page. Organization owners and security managers will see results from all repositories.

For more information about access to security alerts and related views, see [Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository#granting-access-to-security-alerts) and [About custom repository roles](/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/about-custom-repository-roles#security).

For more information, see [Managing your role in an organization owned by your enterprise](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/managing-your-role-in-an-organization-owned-by-your-enterprise).

In the enterprise-level security overview, you can see data for all organizations where you are an **organization owner or security manager**.
