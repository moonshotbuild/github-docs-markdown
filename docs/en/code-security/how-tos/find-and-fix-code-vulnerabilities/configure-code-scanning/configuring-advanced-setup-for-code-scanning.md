# Configuring advanced setup for code scanning

You can configure advanced setup for a repository to find security vulnerabilities in your code using a highly customizable code scanning configuration.

If you do not need a highly customizable code scanning configuration, consider using default setup for code scanning. For more information, see [About setup types for code scanning](/en/code-security/concepts/code-scanning/setup-types).

## Prerequisites

Your repository is eligible for advanced setup if it meets these requirements.

* It uses CodeQL-supported languages or you plan to generate code scanning results with a third-party tool.
* GitHub Actions is enabled.
* It is publicly visible, or GitHub Code Security is enabled.

## Configuring advanced setup for code scanning with CodeQL

You can customize your CodeQL analysis by creating and editing a workflow file. Selecting advanced setup generates a basic workflow file for you to customize using standard workflow syntax and specifying options for the CodeQL action. See [Workflows](/en/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/workflows) and [Workflow configuration options for code scanning](/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/workflow-configuration-options).

Using actions to run code scanning will use minutes. For more information, see [GitHub Actions billing](/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions).

> \[!NOTE]
> You can configure code scanning for any public repository where you have write access.

In the pop-up window that appears, click **Disable CodeQL**.

5. To customize how code scanning scans your code, edit the workflow.

   Generally, you can commit the CodeQL analysis workflow without making any changes to it. However, many of the third-party workflows require additional configuration, so read the comments in the workflow before committing.

   For more information, see [Workflow configuration options for code scanning](/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/workflow-configuration-options) and [CodeQL code scanning for compiled languages](/en/code-security/how-tos/find-and-fix-code-vulnerabilities/manage-your-configuration/codeql-for-compiled-languages).

6. Click **Commit changes...** to display the commit changes form.

   ![Screenshot of the form to create a new file. To the right of the file name, a green button, labeled "Commit changes...", is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/repository/start-commit-commit-new-file.png)

7. In the commit message field, type a commit message.

8. Choose whether you'd like to commit directly to the default branch, or create a new branch and start a pull request.

9. Click **Commit new file** to commit the workflow file to the default branch or click **Propose new file** to commit the file to a new branch.

10. If you created a new branch, click **Create pull request** and open a pull request to merge your change into the default branch.

In the suggested CodeQL analysis workflow, code scanning is configured to analyze your code each time you either push a change to the default branch or any protected branches, or raise a pull request against the default branch. As a result, code scanning will now commence.

The `on:pull_request` and `on:push` triggers for code scanning are each useful for different purposes. See [Workflow configuration options for code scanning](/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/workflow-configuration-options#scan-frequency) and [Triggering a workflow](/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow).

For information on bulk enablement, see [Configuring advanced setup for code scanning with CodeQL at scale](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-at-scale/configure-organization-security/configure-specific-tools/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning-with-codeql-at-scale).

## Configuring code scanning using third-party actions

GitHub includes workflow templates for third-party actions, as well as the CodeQL action. Using a workflow template is much easier than writing a workflow unaided.

Using actions to run code scanning will use minutes. For more information, see [GitHub Actions billing](/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions).

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Under your repository name, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-play" aria-label="play" role="img"><path d="M8 0a8 8 0 1 1 0 16A8 8 0 0 1 8 0ZM1.5 8a6.5 6.5 0 1 0 13 0 6.5 6.5 0 0 0-13 0Zm4.879-2.773 4.264 2.559a.25.25 0 0 1 0 .428l-4.264 2.559A.25.25 0 0 1 6 10.559V5.442a.25.25 0 0 1 .379-.215Z"></path></svg> Actions**.

   ![Screenshot of the tabs for the "github/docs" repository. The "Actions" tab is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-tab-global-nav-update.png)

3. If the repository has already at least one workflow configured and running, click **New workflow** to display workflow templates. If there are currently no workflows configured for the repository, go to the next step.

   ![Screenshot of the Actions tab for a repository. The "New workflow" button is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/security/actions-new-workflow-button.png)

4. In the "Choose a workflow" or "Get started with GitHub Actions" view, scroll down to the "Security" category and click **Configure** under the workflow you want to configure. You may need to click **View all** to find the security workflow you want to configure.

   ![Screenshot of the Security category of workflow templates. The Configure button and "View all" link are highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/actions-workflows-security-section.png)

5. Follow any instructions in the workflow to customize it to your needs. For more general assistance about workflows, click **Documentation** on the right pane of the workflow page.

   ![Screenshot showing a workflow template file open for editing. The "Documentation" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/actions-workflows-documentation.png)

6. When you have finished defining your configuration, add the new workflow to your default branch.

   For more information, see [Using workflow templates](/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/use-workflow-templates#choosing-and-using-a-workflow-template) and [Workflow configuration options for code scanning](/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/workflow-configuration-options).

## Next steps

After your workflow runs successfully at least once, you are ready to start examining and resolving code scanning alerts. For more information on code scanning alerts, see [Code scanning alerts](/en/code-security/concepts/code-scanning/code-scanning-alerts) and [Assessing code scanning alerts for your repository](/en/code-security/how-tos/manage-security-alerts/manage-code-scanning-alerts/assess-alerts).

Learn how code scanning runs behave as checks on pull requests, see [Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/en/code-security/how-tos/manage-security-alerts/manage-code-scanning-alerts/triage-alerts-in-pull-requests).

You can find detailed information about your code scanning configuration, including timestamps for each scan and the percentage of files scanned, on the tool status page. For more information, see [Use the tool status page for code scanning](/en/code-security/how-tos/find-and-fix-code-vulnerabilities/manage-your-configuration/use-the-tools-status-page-for-code-scanning).
