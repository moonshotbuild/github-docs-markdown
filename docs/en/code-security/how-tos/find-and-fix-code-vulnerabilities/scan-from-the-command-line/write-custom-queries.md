# Writing custom queries for the CodeQL CLI

You can write your own CodeQL queries to find specific vulnerabilities and errors.

This article is specifically about writing queries to use with the [database analyze](/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/codeql/codeql-cli-manual/database-analyze) command to produce [interpreted results](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/about-codeql/#interpret-query-results). For conceptual information about custom queries, see [Custom CodeQL queries](/en/code-security/concepts/code-scanning/codeql/custom-queries).

## Writing a valid query

Before running a custom analysis you need to write a valid query, and save it in a file with a `.ql` extension. There is extensive documentation available to help you write queries. For more information, see [CodeQL queries](https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/codeql-queries/#codeql-queries).

## Including query metadata

When running queries with the `database analyze` command, you must include the following two properties to ensure that the results are interpreted correctly:

* Query identifier (`@id`): a sequence of words composed of lowercase letters or digits, delimited by `/` or `-`, identifying and classifying the query.

* Query type (`@kind`): identifies the query as a simple alert (`@kind problem`), an alert documented by a sequence of code locations (`@kind path-problem`), for extractor troubleshooting (`@kind diagnostic`), or a summary metric (`@kind metric` and `@tags summary`).

For more information about these metadata properties, see [Metadata for CodeQL queries](https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/metadata-for-codeql-queries/#metadata-for-codeql-queries) and the [Query metadata style guide](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/docs/query-metadata-style-guide.md).

## Including query help for custom CodeQL queries in SARIF files

For information about query help and documentation formats, see [Custom CodeQL queries](/en/code-security/concepts/code-scanning/codeql/custom-queries#query-documentation).

To include query help in SARIF files when running code scanning analyses:

1. Write your query help in one of the following formats:
   * **Markdown file**: Save a Markdown file alongside your query with the same name (for example, `my-query.md` for `my-query.ql`)
   * **`.qhelp` file**: Write query help in `.qhelp` format, then convert it to Markdown before running the analysis. For more information, see [Query help files](https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/query-help-files/#query-help-files) and [Testing query help files](/en/code-security/how-tos/find-and-fix-code-vulnerabilities/scan-from-the-command-line/test-query-help-files).
2. Run `codeql database analyze` with the `--sarif-add-query-help` option:

   ```shell
   codeql database analyze <database> --format=sarif-latest --output=results.sarif --sarif-add-query-help
   ```

   > \[!NOTE]
   > The `--sarif-add-query-help` option is available from CodeQL CLI v2.7.1 onwards.
3. Upload the SARIF file to GitHub.

## Next steps

To share and use your custom queries, see [Publishing and using CodeQL packs](/en/code-security/how-tos/find-and-fix-code-vulnerabilities/scan-from-the-command-line/publish-and-use-packs).
