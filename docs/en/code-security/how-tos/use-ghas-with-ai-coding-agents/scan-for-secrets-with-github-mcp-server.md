# Scanning for secrets with the GitHub MCP server

Detect exposed secrets in real time from your AI coding agent, before they ever reach your repository.

The GitHub Model Context Protocol (MCP) server lets you run secret scanning directly from GitHub Copilot agent mode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and other MCP-compatible tools. Scan your code for exposed keys, tokens, and credentials as you work, and fix them before you push.

The secret scanning tools are only available via the GitHub remote MCP server. **Local MCP server configurations are not supported**.

This works with any MCP-compatible agent or IDE, including Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. The experience varies across clients.

> \[!NOTE] Findings returned by MCP-invoked scans are **ephemeral**. They are surfaced in your agent's chat for the current session only and are not persisted as alerts on GitHub. This means these findings won't appear in the Security tab, in the secret scanning alerts list, or in the REST/GraphQL APIs for alerts. MCP scans should be treated as a pre-commit safety check, not as a system of record. Remediate findings before they are pushed to the repository and persisted in Git history.

## Prerequisites

* **GitHub Secret Protection** is enabled for the repository.
* **GitHub MCP server** is connected in your IDE or agent. See [Setting up the GitHub MCP Server](/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-mcp-in-your-ide/set-up-the-github-mcp-server).
* Your organization's **security configuration** determines which secret types are detected and whether push protection is enforced. The MCP tools respect your organization's push protection configuration (repository-level push protection settings are not used).

## Step 1:  Install and configure tools

### Enable the `secret_protection` toolset

Enable the `secret_protection` toolset to make the scanning tools available to your agent. The default toolsets do not include it.

The `run_secret_scanning` tool is currently attached to the `copilot` toolset rather than `secret_protection`. You must explicitly include `run_secret_scanning` as an additional tool alongside the `secret_protection` toolset in your MCP configuration.

<div class="ghd-tool cli">

GitHub Copilot CLI has the GitHub MCP server built in:

```shell
copilot mcp --toolsets=secret_protection --tools=run_secret_scanning
```

</div>

<div class="ghd-tool vscode">

Add the `secret_protection` toolset and the `run_secret_scanning tool` to your MCP configuration:

```json copy
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "X-MCP-Toolsets": "secret_protection",
        "X-MCP-Tools": "run_secret_scanning"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="ghd-tool jetbrains">

In your JetBrains IDE, edit your MCP server configuration to include the `secret_protection` toolset and `run_secret_scanning` tool headers. For more information on configuring MCP servers in JetBrains, see [MCP Server](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/mcp-server.html) in the JetBrains documentation.

```json copy
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "GitHub-MCP-Toolsets": "secret_protection",
        "GitHub-MCP-Tools": "run_secret_scanning"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

### (Optional) Install the Advanced Security plugin

The [Advanced Security plugin](https://github.com/github/copilot-plugins/tree/main/plugins/advanced-security) gives you a `/secret-scanning` slash command for a streamlined scanning experience in GitHub Copilot CLI and Visual Studio Code.
The plugin uses the MCP tools under the hood, so you'll still need to enable the `secret_protection` toolset.

Instructions for installing the plugin:

* For **GitHub Copilot CLI**, see [Finding and installing plugins for GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-finding-installing#installing-plugins).
* For **Visual Studio Code**, see [Discover and install plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-plugins#_discover-and-install-plugins) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

## Step 2: Scan your code

Once the toolset is enabled, you can trigger a scan in several ways depending on your client.

**Natural-language prompt**. In any MCP-compatible agent, you can ask:

> "Scan my current changes for exposed secrets and show me the files and lines I should update before I commit."

> "Run secret scanning on the files I've changed since my last commit and summarize any high-confidence findings."

**Slash command (requires the Advanced Security plugin)**. If you installed the optional plugin in Step 1, you can also use:

> "/secret-scanning Review the staged diff for credentials, keys, or tokens and propose replacements using environment variables."

**Direct tool invocation:** You can also invoke the scanning tool directly from your client.

<div class="ghd-tool cli">

Run `copilot --add-github-mcp-tool run_secret_scanning`.

</div>

<div class="ghd-tool vscode">

Type `/secret-scanning` in Copilot Chat.

</div>

<div class="ghd-tool jetbrains">

1. In your IDE, open Copilot Chat
2. Click the **Agent** tab
3. Use a prompt like: "Scan my recent changes for exposed secrets before I commit." You can also click the tools icon in the chat box to browse available `secret_protection` tools directly.

</div>

The agent returns:

* The **type** of secret found
* The **file and line** where it was detected
* **Remediation steps**, such as removing or rotating the credential

If push protection is enabled, the MCP server also blocks secrets from being included in any actions it takes on your behalf, such as commits, pull requests, or the creation of files. See [Working with push protection and the GitHub MCP server](/en/code-security/concepts/secret-security/push-protection-and-the-github-mcp-server).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                  | Check                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scanning returns no results              | Verify the `secret_protection` toolset is enabled in your MCP configuration.                                                                           |
| Repository not eligible                  | Secret scanning via MCP is available to public repositories and requires GitHub Secret Protection to be enabled for private and internal repositories. |
| Agent doesn't recognize the tool         | Confirm your IDE or agent supports MCP. See [About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/en/copilot/concepts/context/mcp#availability).                       |
| Unexpected detection results             | Your organization's security configuration controls which patterns are scanned. Check your repository security settings.                               |
| Tool works in one client but not another | The experience varies across MCP-compatible clients. Check your client's MCP documentation for supported features.                                     |
