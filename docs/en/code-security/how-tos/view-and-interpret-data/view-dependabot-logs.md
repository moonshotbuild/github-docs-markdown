# Viewing Dependabot job logs

Access job logs to troubleshoot failed Dependabot updates and understand what is happening.

When Dependabot updates fail or behave unexpectedly, job logs show you exactly what happened. Access job logs from the dependency graph to debug issues quickly. For background on what job logs contain and the types of jobs GitHub records, see [Dependabot job logs](/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/dependabot-job-logs).
