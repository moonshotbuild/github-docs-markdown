# Assessing adoption of security features

See which teams and repositories have already enabled features for secure coding, and identify any that are not yet protected.

You can use security overview to see which repositories and teams have already enabled each security feature, and where people need more encouragement to adopt these features.

> \[!NOTE] "Pull request alerts" are reported as enabled only when code scanning has analyzed at least one pull request since alerts were enabled for the repository.

## Acting on enablement data

After you have reviewed enablement coverage, consider the following actions.

1. Check if your enterprise has configured overly restrictive policies that limit the use of security features. See [Enforcing policies for code security and analysis for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/enforcing-policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-code-security-and-analysis-for-your-enterprise).

2. Enable features that should be enabled on all repositories. For information on enabling features for a whole organization, see [Configuring security features in your organization](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-at-scale/configure-organization-security).

   For example, secret scanning alerts and push protection reduce the risk of a security leak no matter what information is stored in the repository. If you see repositories that don't already use these features, you should either enable them or discuss an enablement plan with the team who owns the repository.

3. For other features, consider whether the feature should be enabled in more repositories. For example, there would be no point in enabling Dependabot for repositories that only use ecosystems or languages that are unsupported. As such, it's normal to have some repositories where these features are not enabled.

## Next steps

You can download a CSV file of the data displayed on the "Security coverage" page. This data file can be used for efforts like security research and in-depth data analysis, and can integrate easily with external datasets. See [Exporting data from security overview](/en/code-security/how-tos/view-and-interpret-data/analyze-organization-data/export-data).

You can use the "Enablement trends" view to see enablement status and enablement status trends over time for Dependabot, code scanning, or secret scanning across repositories or organizations. See [Viewing enablement trends for an organization](#viewing-enablement-trends-for-an-organization) or [Viewing enablement trends for an enterprise](#viewing-enablement-trends-for-an-enterprise).
