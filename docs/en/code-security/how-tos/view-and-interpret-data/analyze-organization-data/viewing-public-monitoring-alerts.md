# Viewing public monitoring alerts

Find out which credentials your enterprise members have exposed in public repositories across GitHub.

> \[!NOTE]
> Public monitoring for secret scanning is currently in public preview and subject to change. If you have feedback, please join the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/code-security).

## About the public monitoring page

The **Public monitoring** page is a dedicated view within the enterprise-level security overview. It displays alerts for secrets detected in public repositories across GitHub that are attributed to your enterprise members or users with an email matching your enterprise's verified domain.

> \[!NOTE]
> The Public monitoring page is available at the enterprise level only. It is not available at the organization level.

## Prerequisites

Public monitoring must be enabled for your enterprise. See [Enabling public monitoring for your enterprise](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-at-scale/configure-enterprise-security/manage-your-coverage/enabling-public-monitoring-for-your-enterprise).

## Viewing public monitoring alerts

1. Navigate to your enterprise. For example, from the [Enterprises](https://github.com/settings/enterprises?ref_product=ghec\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text) page on GitHub.com.

2.

   The alert list shows each detected secret with the following details:

   * The type of secret detected (for example, "Google API Key")
   * A partial secret value
   * Who the leak is attributed to and in which public repository
   * How long ago the secret was detected

4. Click an alert to open the detail panel. The panel includes:
   * The date the secret was committed
   * The full secret literal
   * Attribution details, including the committer's username and email
   * The file location where the secret was detected, with the secret highlighted in context
   * A **Recommendations** tab with suggested remediation steps
