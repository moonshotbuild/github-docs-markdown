# Fixing code quality findings in your repository backlog

Generate autofixes for findings on the default branch of your repository, or dismiss findings that aren't relevant.

> \[!TIP]
> If you're new to Code Quality, see [Raising your repository's code quality score](/en/code-security/tutorials/improve-code-quality/raise-your-quality-rating?utm_campaign=code-quality-ga-july-2026\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_source=docs-fix-backlog-walkthrough-tip) for a guided walkthrough of reviewing and improving your repository's quality scores.

## How Code Quality works on your default branch

Code Quality scans your default branch and reports findings on "Code quality" pages on the **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-shield" aria-label="shield" role="img"><path d="M7.467.133a1.748 1.748 0 0 1 1.066 0l5.25 1.68A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 15 3.48V7c0 1.566-.32 3.182-1.303 4.682-.983 1.498-2.585 2.813-5.032 3.855a1.697 1.697 0 0 1-1.33 0c-2.447-1.042-4.049-2.357-5.032-3.855C1.32 10.182 1 8.566 1 7V3.48a1.75 1.75 0 0 1 1.217-1.667Zm.61 1.429a.25.25 0 0 0-.153 0l-5.25 1.68a.25.25 0 0 0-.174.238V7c0 1.358.275 2.666 1.057 3.86.784 1.194 2.121 2.34 4.366 3.297a.196.196 0 0 0 .154 0c2.245-.956 3.582-2.104 4.366-3.298C13.225 9.666 13.5 8.36 13.5 7V3.48a.251.251 0 0 0-.174-.237l-5.25-1.68ZM8.75 4.75v3a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-3a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 10.5a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z"></path></svg> Security and quality** tab of your repository. It runs **two types of analysis**.

1. **Standard findings**: Code Quality uses CodeQL to perform a deterministic, rules-based scan of your default branch. Finding are grouped by rule and language, labeled by severity (**Error**, **Warning**, **Note**), and each includes a suggested autofix.

2. **AI findings**: Code Quality uses AI-powered analysis to identify quality issues in the files most recently pushed to your default branch, including issues that rule-based analysis may not detect - such as best practices, naming conventions, or design considerations.

> \[!NOTE]
> The "AI findings" page for recently changed files is currently in public preview and subject to change.

For information on resolving AI findings, see [Fixing code quality findings in recently merged files](/en/code-security/how-tos/maintain-quality-code/fix-findings-in-recent-merges).

## Resolving a standard finding

1. Navigate to the **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-shield" aria-label="shield" role="img"><path d="M7.467.133a1.748 1.748 0 0 1 1.066 0l5.25 1.68A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 15 3.48V7c0 1.566-.32 3.182-1.303 4.682-.983 1.498-2.585 2.813-5.032 3.855a1.697 1.697 0 0 1-1.33 0c-2.447-1.042-4.049-2.357-5.032-3.855C1.32 10.182 1 8.566 1 7V3.48a1.75 1.75 0 0 1 1.217-1.667Zm.61 1.429a.25.25 0 0 0-.153 0l-5.25 1.68a.25.25 0 0 0-.174.238V7c0 1.358.275 2.666 1.057 3.86.784 1.194 2.121 2.34 4.366 3.297a.196.196 0 0 0 .154 0c2.245-.956 3.582-2.104 4.366-3.298C13.225 9.666 13.5 8.36 13.5 7V3.48a.251.251 0 0 0-.174-.237l-5.25-1.68ZM8.75 4.75v3a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-3a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 10.5a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z"></path></svg> Security and quality** tab of your repository.

3. Use the dashboard filters to focus on the findings most likely to affect your quality scores. For example, to see all "Error"-level findings for "Reliability", set the filter to:

   `is:open category:reliability severity:error`

4. Findings are grouped by rule. Click a rule name to be taken to a detailed view of all findings for that rule.

   ![Screenshot showing a rule in the "Standard findings" view. The rule name is highlighted in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/code-quality/click-rule-name.png)

5. Click **Show more**, then review the explanation of the rule, what the recommended fix is, supporting code examples and references.

   ![Screenshot showing the results for a code quality rule. The text "Show more" is highlighted in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/code-quality/click-show-more.png)

6. To the right of an individual finding, click **Generate fix**.

7. Review the diff of the proposed change. If you agree with it, click **Open pull request**.

8. In the "Commit autofix to branch" dialog, select "Open a pull request", then click **Commit change**.

9. When the autofix pull request is ready for review, change its status from "Draft" to "Ready for review", and wait for CI checks to pass before merging.

10. Alternatively, if a finding isn't relevant or actionable, click **Dismiss**. For example, you might dismiss a finding that is in legacy code no longer maintained, is a known exception to your team's coding standards, or is a false positive that doesn't pose a real quality risk.

To raise a maintainability or reliability score, you must resolve every finding at the highest severity level currently affecting that metric. See [Metrics and scores reference](/en/code-security/reference/code-quality/metrics-and-ratings).

## Verifying that your code quality scores have updated

After your autofix pull requests are merged, return to the "Standard findings" view to confirm that:

* The number of findings has decreased.
* The maintainability or reliability score has improved, if you resolved all findings at the current minimum severity level for that metric.
