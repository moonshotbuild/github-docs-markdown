# Fixing code quality findings in recently merged files

Apply autofixes or delegate remediation work to Copilot for quality issues detected by AI-powered analysis of recently merged code.

> \[!TIP]
> If you're new to Code Quality, see [Raising your repository's code quality score](/en/code-security/tutorials/improve-code-quality/raise-your-quality-rating?utm_campaign=code-quality-ga-july-2026\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_source=docs-fix-recent-merges-walkthrough-tip) for a guided walkthrough of reviewing and improving your repository's quality scores.

## How Code Quality analyzes recently merged files

Code Quality runs an AI-powered scan on recently changed files after code is merged to your default branch. This scan uses a large language model to report up to 5 findings per file in up to 5 files—across all languages, without being limited to predefined rules.

> \[!NOTE]
> The "AI findings" page for recently changed files is currently in public preview and subject to change.

## Resolving a finding

You can delegate remediation work to Copilot or open a pull request yourself.

### Delegate to Copilot

You need a Copilot license to assign work to Copilot cloud agent. <br><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot/plans?ref_product=copilot&ref_type=purchase&ref_style=button&utm_campaign=code-quality-ga-july-2026&utm_medium=docs&utm_source=docs-fix-findings-merge-copilot-signup" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary mt-3 mr-3 no-underline"><span>Sign up for Copilot</span> <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-link-external" aria-label="link external icon" role="img"><path d="M3.75 2h3.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-3.5a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v8.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h8.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-3.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0v3.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 12.25 14h-8.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 2 12.25v-8.5C2 2.784 2.784 2 3.75 2Zm6.854-1h4.146a.25.25 0 0 1 .25.25v4.146a.25.25 0 0 1-.427.177L13.03 4.03 9.28 7.78a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042l3.75-3.75-1.543-1.543A.25.25 0 0 1 10.604 1Z"></path></svg></a>

1. Select the file or files you want to include for the fix, then click **Assign to Copilot**.
2. There is a delay while Copilot sets up the work. When the pull request is open and work is in progress, a banner is displayed with a link to the pull request.
3. Track Copilot's work:
   * In the pull request, the summary is updated as work progresses.
   * Using the [agents page](https://github.com/copilot/agents?ref_product=copilot\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text\&utm_campaign=code-quality-ga-july-2026\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_source=docs-fix-findings-merge-agent-page) or session logs. See [Managing agent sessions](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/use-copilot-agents/manage-and-track-agents).
