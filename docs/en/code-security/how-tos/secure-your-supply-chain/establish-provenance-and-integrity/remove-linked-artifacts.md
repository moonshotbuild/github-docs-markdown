# Removing artifacts from the linked artifacts page

Set the storage and deployment status of artifacts to reflect that they are no longer in use.

It is **not possible** to delete an artifact from the linked artifacts page. However, if an artifact has been removed from your organization's registry or is no longer deployed anywhere, you can update an artifact's storage or deployment record to reflect its status.

## Updating a storage record

When you delete an artifact from your external registry, you can use the [Create artifact metadata storage record](/en/rest/orgs/artifact-metadata#create-artifact-metadata-storage-record) API endpoint to set the status of an existing artifact to `deleted`. You can also mark an artifact as `eol`.

This information is displayed as a tag next to the artifact repository name.

If you have deleted an artifact from a registry, you should also remove any attestations associated with the artifact. See [Managing the lifecycle of artifact attestations](/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/use-artifact-attestations/manage-attestations).

## Updating a deployment record

When an artifact stops being deployed in a given environment, you can use the [Create an artifact deployment record](/en/rest/orgs/artifact-metadata#create-an-artifact-deployment-record) API endpoint to set the deployment's status to `decommissioned`.

This information is reflected in the icon next to the deployment record.
