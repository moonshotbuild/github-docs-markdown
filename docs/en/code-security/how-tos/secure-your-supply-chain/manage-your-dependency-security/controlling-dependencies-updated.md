# Controlling which dependencies are updated by Dependabot

Learn how to configure your dependabot.yml file so that Dependabot automatically updates the packages you specify, in the way you define.

You can customize your Dependabot configuration to suit your needs, by adding options to your `dependabot.yml` file. For example, you can make sure that Dependabot uses the correct package manifest files, and updates only the dependencies you want maintained.

This article collates customization options you may find useful.

## Defining multiple locations for manifest files

If you want to enable Dependabot version updates for manifest files stored in more than one location, you can use `directories` in place of `directory`. For example, this configuration sets two different update schedules for manifest files stored in different directories.

```yaml copy
# Specify the locations of the manifest files to update for each package manager
# using both `directories` and `directory`

version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "bundler"
    # Update manifest files stored in these directories weekly
    directories:
      - "/frontend"
      - "/backend"
      - "/admin"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
  - package-ecosystem: "bundler"
    # Update manifest files stored in the root directory daily
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```

* To specify a range of directories using a pattern

  ```yaml copy
  # Specify the root directory and directories that start with "lib-",
  # using globbing, for locations of manifest files

  version: 2
  updates:
    - package-ecosystem: "composer"
      directories:
        - "/"
        - "/lib-*"
      schedule:
        interval: "weekly"
  ```

* To specify manifests in the current directory and recursive subdirectories

  ```yaml copy
  # Specify all directories from the current layer and below recursively,
  # using globstar, for locations of manifest files

  version: 2
  updates:
    - package-ecosystem: "composer"
      directories:
        - "**/*"
      schedule:
        interval: "weekly"
  ```

## Ignoring specific dependencies

If you are not ready to adopt changes from certain dependencies in your project, you can configure Dependabot to ignore those dependencies when it opens pull requests for version updates and security updates. You can do this using one of the following methods.

* Configure the `ignore` option for the dependency in your `dependabot.yml` file.
  * **You can use this to ignore updates for specific dependencies, versions, and types of updates.**
  * For more information, see `ignore` in [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#ignore--).
* Use `@dependabot ignore` comment commands on a Dependabot pull request for version updates and security updates.
  * **You can use comment commands to ignore updates for specific dependencies and versions.**
  * For more information, see [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/manage-dependabot-prs#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-with-comment-commands).

Here are some examples showing how `ignore` can be used to customize which dependencies are updated.

* To ignore updates beyond a specific version

  ```yaml copy
  ignore:
    - dependency-name: "lodash:*"
      # Ignore versions of Lodash that are equal to or greater than 1.0.0
      versions: [ ">=1.0.0" ]
  ```

  ```yaml copy
  ignore:
    - dependency-name: "sphinx"
      versions: [ "[1.1,)" ]
  ```

* To ignore patch updates

  ```yaml copy
  ignore:
    - dependency-name: "@types/node"
      # Ignore patch updates for Node
      update-types: ["version-update:semver-patch"]
  ```

* To ignore specific versions or version ranges, see [Ignoring specific versions or ranges of versions](#ignoring-specific-versions-or-ranges-of-versions).

If you want to un-ignore a dependency or ignore condition, you can delete the ignore conditions from the `dependabot.yml` file or reopen the pull request.

For pull requests for grouped updates, you can also use `@dependabot unignore` comment commands. The `@dependabot unignore` comment commands enable you to do the following by commenting on a Dependabot pull request:

* Un-ignore a specific ignore condition
* Un-ignore a specific dependency
* Un-ignore all ignore conditions for all dependencies in a Dependabot pull request

For more information, see [Managing pull requests for dependency updates](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/manage-dependabot-prs#managing-dependabot-pull-requests-for-grouped-updates-with-comment-commands).

## Allowing specific dependencies to be updated

You can use `allow` to tell Dependabot about the dependencies you want to maintain. `allow` is usually used in conjunction with `ignore`.

For more information, see `allow` in [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#allow--).

By default, Dependabot creates version update pull requests only for the dependencies that are explicitly defined in a manifest (`direct` dependencies). This configuration uses `allow` to tell Dependabot that we want it to maintain `all` types of dependency. That is, both the `direct` dependencies and their dependencies (also known as indirect dependencies, sub-dependencies, or transient dependencies). In addition, the configuration tells Dependabot to ignore all dependencies with a name matching the pattern `org.xwiki.*` because we have a different process for maintaining them.

> \[!TIP]
> Dependabot checks for all **allowed** dependencies, then filters out any **ignored** dependencies. If a dependency is matched by an **allow** and an **ignore** statement, then it is ignored. You can also use `update-types` in `allow` rules to restrict updates to specific semantic versioning levels.

```yaml copy
version: 2
registries:
  # Helps find updates for non Maven Central dependencies
  maven-xwiki-public:
    type: maven-repository
    url: https://nexus.xwiki.org/nexus/content/groups/public/
    username: ""
    password: ""
  # Required to resolve xwiki-common SNAPSHOT parent pom
  maven-xwiki-snapshots:
    type: maven-repository
    url: https://maven.xwiki.org/snapshots
    username: ""
    password: ""
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "maven"
    directory: "/"
    registries:
      - maven-xwiki-public
      - maven-xwiki-snapshots
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    allow:
      # Allow both direct and indirect updates for all packages.
      - dependency-type: "all"
    ignore:
      # Ignore XWiki dependencies. We have a separate process for updating them
      - dependency-name: "org.xwiki.*"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 15
```

## Allowing specific semantic versioning levels for updates

You can use `update-types` with `allow` to restrict updates to specific semantic versioning (SemVer) levels. This is useful when you want to be explicit about which types of updates Dependabot should create pull requests for.

> \[!NOTE]
> `update-types` only affects *version* updates, not *security* updates. Security updates will always be created regardless of the `update-types` setting.

For more information, see `update-types` in [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#update-types-allow).

Here are some examples showing how `update-types` can be used with `allow`.

* To allow only minor and patch updates for a specific dependency, you can combine `update-types` with `dependency-name`.

  ```yaml copy
  version: 2
  updates:
    - package-ecosystem: "maven"
      directory: "/"
      schedule:
        interval: "weekly"
      allow:
        - dependency-name: "io.micrometer:micrometer-core"
          update-types:
            - "version-update:semver-minor"
            - "version-update:semver-patch"
  ```

* To apply different update policies for production and development dependencies, you can combine `update-types` with `dependency-type`.

  ```yaml copy
  version: 2
  updates:
    - package-ecosystem: "composer"
      directory: "/"
      schedule:
        interval: "monthly"
      allow:
        - dependency-type: "production"
          update-types:
            - "version-update:semver-patch"
        - dependency-type: "development"
          update-types:
            - "version-update:semver-minor"
            - "version-update:semver-patch
  ```

  In this example, production dependencies will only receive patch updates, while development dependencies will receive both minor and patch updates.

## Ignoring specific versions or ranges of versions

You can use `versions` in conjunction with `ignore` to ignore specific versions or ranges of versions.

For more information, see `versions` in [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#versions-ignore).

* To ignore a specific version

  ```yaml copy
  ignore:
    - dependency-name: "django*"
      # Ignore version 11
      versions: [ "11" ]
  ```

* To ignore a range of versions

  ```yaml copy
      ignore:
        - dependency-name: "@types/node"
          versions: ["15.x", "14.x", "13.x"]
        - dependency-name: "xdg-basedir"
          # 5.0.0 has breaking changes as they switch to named exports
          # and convert the module to ESM
          # We can't use it until we switch to ESM across the project
          versions: ["5.x"]
        - dependency-name: "limiter"
          # 2.0.0 has breaking changes
          # so we want to delay updating.
          versions: ["2.x"]
  ```

## Specifying the semantic versioning level to ignore

You can specify one or more semantic versioning (SemVer) levels to ignore using `update-types` with `ignore`. Alternatively, you can use `update-types` with `allow` to explicitly specify which update levels to allow, see [Allowing specific semantic versioning levels for updates](#allowing-specific-semantic-versioning-levels-for-updates).

For more information, see `update-types` in [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#update-types-ignore).

In this example, Dependabot will ignore patch versions for Node.

```yaml copy
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    ignore:
      - dependency-name: "express"
        # For Express, ignore all updates for version 4 and 5
        versions: ["4.x", "5.x"]
        # For Lodash, ignore all updates
      - dependency-name: "lodash"
      - dependency-name: "@types/node"
        # For Node types, ignore any patch versions
        update-types: ["version-update:semver-patch"]
```

## Defining a versioning strategy

By default, Dependabot tries to increase the minimum version requirement for dependencies it identifies as apps, and widens the allowed version requirements to include both the new and old versions for dependencies it identifies as libraries.

You can change this default strategy. For more information, see `versioning-strategy` in [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#versioning-strategy--).

In this example, Dependabot will increase the minimum version requirement to match the new version for both apps and libraries.

```yaml copy
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: daily
    # Increase the minimum version for all npm dependencies
    versioning-strategy: increase
```

In this example, Dependabot will **only** increase the minimum version requirement if the original constraint does not allow the new version.

```yaml copy
version: 2
updates:
- package-ecosystem: pip
  directory: "/"
  schedule:
    interval: daily
  open-pull-requests-limit: 20
  rebase-strategy: "disabled"
  # Increase the version requirements for pip
  # only when required
  versioning-strategy: increase-if-necessary
```

## Updating vendored dependencies

You can instruct Dependabot to vendor specific dependencies when updating them.

Dependabot automatically maintains vendored dependencies for Go modules, and you can configure Bundler to also update vendored dependencies.

For more information, see `vendor` in [Dependabot options reference](/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference#vendor--).

In this example, `vendor` is set to `true` for Bundler, which means that Dependabot will also maintain dependencies for Bundler that are stored in the *vendor/cache* directory in the repository.

```yaml copy
version: 2
updates:
- package-ecosystem: bundler
  directory: "/"
  # Vendoring Bundler
  vendor: true
  schedule:
    interval: weekly
    day: saturday
  open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```
