# Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database

Improve advisories published in the GitHub Advisory Database by making community contributions.

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories?ref_product=security-advisories\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text).
2. Select the security advisory you would like to contribute to.
3. On the right-hand side of the page, click the **Suggest improvements for this vulnerability** link.
4. In the "Improve security advisory" form, make the desired improvements. You can edit or add any detail. For information about correctly specifying information on the form, including affected versions, see [Best practices for writing repository security advisories](/en/code-security/tutorials/fix-reported-vulnerabilities/write-security-advisories).
5. Under **Reason for change**, explain why you want to make this improvement. If you include links to supporting material this will help our reviewers.
6. When you finish editing the advisory, click **Submit improvements**.
7. Once you submit your community contribution, a pull request containing your changes will be created for review in [github/advisory-database](https://github.com/github/advisory-database) by the GitHub Security Lab curation team. If the advisory originated from a GitHub repository, we will also tag the original publisher for optional commentary. You can view the pull request and get notifications when it is updated or closed.

You can also open a pull request directly on an advisory file in the [github/advisory-database](https://github.com/github/advisory-database) repository. For more information, see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
