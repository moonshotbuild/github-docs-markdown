# Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database

You can browse the GitHub Advisory Database to find CVEs and GitHub-originated advisories affecting the open source world.

<!--Marketing-LINK: From /features/security/software-supply-chain page "Browsing security vulnerabilities in the GitHub Advisory Database".-->

## Accessing an advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database

You can access any advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database.

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories?ref_product=security-advisories\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text).

2. Optionally, to filter the list of advisories, use the search field or the drop-down menus at the top of the list.

   > \[!NOTE]
   > You can use the sidebar on the left to explore GitHub-reviewed and unreviewed advisories separately, or to filter by ecosystem.

3. Click an advisory to view details. By default, you will see GitHub-reviewed advisories for security vulnerabilities. To show malware advisories, use `type:malware` in the search bar.

The database is also accessible using the GraphQL API. By default, queries will return GitHub-reviewed advisories for security vulnerabilities unless you specify `type:malware`. For more information, see the [Webhook events and payloads](/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#security_advisory).

Additionally, you can access the GitHub Advisory Database using the REST API. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for global security advisories](/en/rest/security-advisories/global-advisories).

## Editing an advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database

You can suggest improvements to any advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database. For more information, see [Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/fix-reported-vulnerabilities/edit-advisory-database).

## Searching the GitHub Advisory Database

You can search the database, and use qualifiers to narrow your search. For example, you can search for advisories created on a certain date, in a specific ecosystem, or in a particular library.

Date formatting must follow the [ISO8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard, which is `YYYY-MM-DD` (year-month-day). You can also add optional time information `THH:MM:SS+00:00` after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's `T`, followed by `HH:MM:SS` (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (`+00:00`).

When you search for a date, you can use greater than, less than, and range qualifiers to further filter results. For more information, see [Understanding the search syntax](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax).

| Qualifier             | Example                                                                                                                                          |

A `GHSA-ID` qualifier is a unique ID that we at GitHub automatically assign to every advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database. For more information about these identifiers, see [About the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/code-security/concepts/vulnerability-reporting-and-management/github-advisory-database#ghsa-ids).

## Viewing your vulnerable repositories

For any GitHub-reviewed advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database, you can see which of your repositories are affected by that security vulnerability or malware. To see a vulnerable repository, you must have access to Dependabot alerts for that repository. For more information, see [Dependabot alerts](/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/dependabot-alerts).

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories?ref_product=security-advisories\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text).
2. Click an advisory.
3. At the top of the advisory page, click **Dependabot alerts**.
   ![Screenshot of a "global security advisory". The "Dependabot alerts" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/advisory-database-dependabot-alerts.png)
4. Optionally, to filter the list, use the search bar or the drop-down menus. The "Organization" drop-down menu allows you to filter the Dependabot alerts per owner (organization or user).
5. For more details about the advisory, and for advice on how to fix the vulnerable repository, click the repository name.
