# Repository properties for code scanning

You can use repository properties to adjust code scanning to suit your needs.

## Prerequisites

For the repository properties described here to have an effect, you need to have set up code scanning. See [About setup types for code scanning](/en/code-security/concepts/code-scanning/setup-types).

Repository properties which affect code scanning must be created manually for your organization. You can then set values for them that apply to your entire organization or allow them to be configured differently for each repository. See [Managing custom properties for repositories in your organization](/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).

## Testing changes before applying them

You may wish to test that configurations applied through repository properties have the desired effects before rolling them out to your entire organization. Repository properties can be set to specific values for individual repositories. If you are configuring a repository property for the first time, create it for your organization but do not set it to a value. Instead, set it to a value for a specific test repository where you can validate the change first. Once validated on a test repository, you can then set the value for your entire organization or the desired repositories.

When changing the value of a supported repository property, you can use the same approach. Override or set the value of the repository property for a test repository, validate the change, and then roll it out to your organization or other repositories.

## Supported repository properties for code scanning

Some code scanning functionality can be configured using repository properties. Organizations can use repository properties to both enforce configurations across all repositories and for individual repositories. If code scanning is customized using repository properties, the customization applies to all setup types.

The following is an overview of repository properties you can set up which affect code scanning analyses when configured:

| Name                                 | Type       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- |
|                                      |            |
| `github-codeql-config-file`          | Text       |
|                                      |            |
| `github-codeql-extra-queries`        | Text       |
| `github-codeql-disable-overlay`      | True/false |
| `github-codeql-file-coverage-on-prs` | True/false |

> \[!NOTE]
> The repository properties which are supported depend on the version of the [github/codeql-action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/) that is used by your code scanning analyses. For code scanning advanced setup, check that your workflow is referencing the latest major version. Code scanning default setup automatically uses the latest version.

### Custom configuration files

You can set the `github-codeql-config-file` property to the local or remote path of a configuration file. Accepted values for this property are the same as for the `config-file` parameter of the `codeql-action/init` action. For more information about accepted path formats and possible contents of configuration files, see [Workflow configuration options for code scanning](/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/workflow-configuration-options#custom-configuration-files).

The repository containing the configuration file can be public, internal, or private. To use a file from an internal or private repository other than the one being analyzed with default setup, you must set up a *Git Source* private registry configuration. We recommend setting the registry URL to the full URL of the repository containing the configuration file, rather than the organization URL, so that the credentials are only used for requests to that repository. See [Giving security features access to private registries](/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-at-scale/configure-organization-security/manage-usage-and-access/giving-org-access-private-registries).

Advanced setup does not use organization-level private registry configurations. To use a configuration file from an internal or private repository with advanced setup, pass a token that can access the repository to the `external-repository-token` input of the `codeql-action/init` action. See [Workflow configuration options for code scanning](/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/workflow-configuration-options#custom-configuration-files).

A value specified for the `github-codeql-config-file` property will apply to both code scanning default setup and code scanning advanced setup. If an advanced setup workflow specifies an explicit input for the `config-file` parameter of the `codeql-action/init` action, then that input will take precedence over the value configured in the repository property. This allows advanced workflows to use different configurations than those applied to default setup workflows, if desired.

A custom configuration file applied using the `github-codeql-config-file` property is merged with the configuration that code scanning default setup generates automatically. Code scanning default setup allows you to customize some analysis settings in the user interface, such as which threat models or CodeQL model packs to use. These selections are kept in the merged configuration: the threat models selected in the default setup UI are combined with any threat models specified in the configuration file, and model packs configured in the UI are kept. See [About setup types for code scanning](/en/code-security/concepts/code-scanning/setup-types#configuration-options) for more information about available configuration options in code scanning default setup.

### Other analysis customization

The `github-codeql-extra-queries` property allows you to configure additional queries that should be run. This is useful to add queries to all relevant analyses in your organization without needing to modify individual workflows or switch to an advanced setup. This accepts the same values as the `queries` input of the [github/codeql-action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/). See [Workflow configuration options for code scanning](/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/workflow-configuration-options).

### Enabling or disabling features

You can disable improved incremental analysis by setting the `github-codeql-disable-overlay` property to `true`. This may be useful if improved incremental analysis is failing because of increased hardware requirements.

File coverage information is not calculated for analyses of pull requests. If you want to enable file coverage information for pull requests, you can set the `github-codeql-file-coverage-on-prs` property to `true`.
