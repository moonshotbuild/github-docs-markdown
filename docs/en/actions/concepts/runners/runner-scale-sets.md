# Runner scale sets

Learn about what a runner scale set is and how they can interact with the Actions Runner Controller.

## About runner scale sets

A runner scale set is a group of homogeneous runners that can be assigned jobs from GitHub Actions. The number of active runners owned by a runner scale set can be controlled by auto-scaling runner solutions such as Actions Runner Controller (ARC).

You can use runner groups to manage runner scale sets. Similar to self-hosted runners, you can add runner scale sets to existing runner groups. However, runner scale sets can belong to only one runner group at a time and can only have one label assigned to them.

To assign jobs to a runner scale set, you must configure your workflow to reference the runner scale set’s name. For more information, see [Using Actions Runner Controller runners in a workflow](/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/use-actions-runner-controller/use-arc-in-a-workflow).
