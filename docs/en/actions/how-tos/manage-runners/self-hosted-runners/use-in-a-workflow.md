# Using self-hosted runners in a workflow

To use self-hosted runners in a workflow, you can use labels or groups to specify the runner for a job.

## Viewing available runners for a repository

If you have `repo: write` access to a repository, you can view a list of the runners available to the repository.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-play" aria-label="play" role="img"><path d="M8 0a8 8 0 1 1 0 16A8 8 0 0 1 8 0ZM1.5 8a6.5 6.5 0 1 0 13 0 6.5 6.5 0 0 0-13 0Zm4.879-2.773 4.264 2.559a.25.25 0 0 1 0 .428l-4.264 2.559A.25.25 0 0 1 6 10.559V5.442a.25.25 0 0 1 .379-.215Z"></path></svg> Actions**.

3. In the left sidebar, under the "Management" section, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-server" aria-label="server" role="img"><path d="M1.75 1h12.5c.966 0 1.75.784 1.75 1.75v4c0 .372-.116.717-.314 1 .198.283.314.628.314 1v4a1.75 1.75 0 0 1-1.75 1.75H1.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 0 12.75v-4c0-.358.109-.707.314-1a1.739 1.739 0 0 1-.314-1v-4C0 1.784.784 1 1.75 1ZM1.5 2.75v4c0 .138.112.25.25.25h12.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-4a.25.25 0 0 0-.25-.25H1.75a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25Zm.25 5.75a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v4c0 .138.112.25.25.25h12.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-4a.25.25 0 0 0-.25-.25ZM7 4.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 4h4.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-4.5A.75.75 0 0 1 7 4.75ZM7.75 10h4.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-4.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5ZM3 4.75A.75.75 0 0 1 3.75 4h.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-.5A.75.75 0 0 1 3 4.75ZM3.75 10h.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-.5a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5Z"></path></svg> Runners**.
4. Click the **Self hosted** tab at the top of the list of runners.
5. Review the list of available self-hosted runners for the repository. This list includes both self-hosted runners and runner scale sets created with Actions Runner Controller. For more information, see [Actions Runner Controller](/en/actions/concepts/runners/actions-runner-controller).
6. Optionally, to copy a runner's label to use it in a workflow, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-kebab-horizontal" aria-label="More options" role="img"><path d="M8 9a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3ZM1.5 9a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Zm13 0a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Z"></path></svg> to the right of the runner, then click **Copy label**.

> \[!NOTE]
> Enterprise and organization owners can create runners from this page. To create a new runner, click **New runner** at the top right of the list of runners to add runners to the repository.

## Using default labels to route jobs

A self-hosted runner automatically receives certain labels when it is added to GitHub Actions. These are used to indicate its operating system and hardware platform:

* `self-hosted`: Default label applied to self-hosted runners.
* `linux`, `windows`, or `macOS`: Applied depending on operating system.
* `x64`, `ARM`, or `ARM64`: Applied depending on hardware architecture.

You can use your workflow's YAML to send jobs to a combination of these labels. In this example, a self-hosted runner that matches all three labels will be eligible to run the job:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, ARM64]
```

* `self-hosted` - Run this job on a self-hosted runner.
* `linux` - Only use a Linux-based runner.
* `ARM64` - Only use a runner based on ARM64 hardware.

To create individual self-hosted runners without the default labels, pass the `--no-default-labels` flag when you create the runner.

## Using custom labels to route jobs

You can create custom labels and assign them to your self-hosted runners at any time. Custom labels let you send jobs to particular types of self-hosted runners, based on how they're labeled.

For example, if you have a job that requires a specific type of graphics hardware, you can create a custom label called `gpu` and assign it to the runners that have the hardware installed. A self-hosted runner that matches all the assigned labels will then be eligible to run the job.

This example shows a job that combines default and custom labels:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]
```

* `self-hosted` - Run this job on a self-hosted runner.
* `linux` - Only use a Linux-based runner.
* `x64` - Only use a runner based on x64 hardware.
* `gpu` - This custom label has been manually assigned to self-hosted runners with the GPU hardware installed.

These labels operate cumulatively, so a self-hosted runner must have all four labels to be eligible to process the job.

## Using groups to route jobs

In this example, runners have been added to a group called `build-runners`. The `runs-on` key sends the job to any available runner in the `build-runners` group:

```yaml
name: learn-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on: 
      group: build-runners
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
```

## Using labels and groups to route jobs

When you combine groups and labels, the runner must meet both requirements to be eligible to run the job.

In this example, the `runs-on` key combines `group` and `labels` so that the job is routed to any available runner within the group that also has a matching label:

```yaml
name: learn-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on:
      group: ubuntu-runners
      labels: ubuntu-24.04-16core
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
```
