# Disabling and enabling a workflow

You can disable and re-enable a workflow using the GitHub UI, the REST API, or GitHub CLI.

Disabling a workflow allows you to stop a workflow from being triggered without having to delete the file from the repo. You can easily re-enable the workflow again on GitHub.

Temporarily disabling a workflow can be useful in many scenarios. These are a few examples where disabling a workflow might be helpful:

* A workflow error that produces too many or wrong requests, impacting external services negatively.
* A workflow that is not critical and is consuming too many minutes on your account.
* A workflow that sends requests to a service that is down.
* Workflows on a forked repository that aren't needed (for example, scheduled workflows).

> \[!WARNING]
> To prevent unnecessary workflow runs, scheduled workflows may be disabled automatically. When a public repository is forked, scheduled workflows are disabled by default. In a public repository, scheduled workflows are automatically disabled when no repository activity has occurred in 60 days.

You can also disable and enable a workflow using the REST API. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for workflows](/en/rest/actions/workflows).

To disable a workflow, use the `workflow disable` subcommand. Replace `workflow` with either the name, ID, or file name of the workflow you want to disable. For example, `"Link Checker"`, `1234567`, or `"link-check-test.yml"`. If you don't specify a workflow, GitHub CLI returns an interactive menu for you to choose a workflow.

```shell
gh workflow disable WORKFLOW
```
