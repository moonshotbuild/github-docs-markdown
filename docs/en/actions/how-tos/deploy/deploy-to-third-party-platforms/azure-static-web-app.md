# Deploying to Azure Static Web App

Learn how to deploy a web app to Azure Static Web App as part of your continuous deployment (CD) workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before creating your GitHub Actions workflow, you will first need to complete the following setup steps:

1. Create an Azure Static Web App using the 'Other' option for deployment source. For more information, see [Quickstart: Building your first static site in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal) in the Azure documentation.

1. Create a secret called `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` with the value of your static web app deployment token. For more information about how to find your deployment token, see [Reset deployment tokens in Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/deployment-token-management) in the Azure documentation.

## Creating the workflow

Once you've completed the prerequisites, you can proceed with creating the workflow.

The following example workflow demonstrates how to build and deploy an Azure static web app when there is a push to the `main` branch or when a pull request targeting `main` is opened, synchronized, or reopened. The workflow also tears down the corresponding pre-production deployment when a pull request targeting `main` is closed.

Under the workflow `env` key, change the following values:
* `APP_LOCATION` to the location of your client code
* `API_LOCATION` to the location of your API source code. If `API_LOCATION` is not relevant, you can delete the variable and the lines where it is used.
* `OUTPUT_LOCATION` to the location of your client code build output

For more information about these values, see [Build configuration for Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/build-configuration?tabs=github-actions) in the Azure documentation.

```yaml copy
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.

* The action used to deploy the web app is the official Azure [`Azure/static-web-apps-deploy`](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-deploy) action.
