# Deploying Java to Azure App Service

Learn how to deploy a Java project to Azure App Service as part of your continuous deployment (CD) workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before creating your GitHub Actions workflow, you will first need to complete the following setup steps:

1. Create an Azure App Service plan.

   For example, you can use the Azure CLI to create a new App Service plan:

   ```bash copy
   az appservice plan create \
      --resource-group MY_RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --name MY_APP_SERVICE_PLAN \
      --is-linux
   ```

   In the command above, replace `MY_RESOURCE_GROUP` with your pre-existing Azure Resource Group, and `MY_APP_SERVICE_PLAN` with a new name for the App Service plan.

   See the Azure documentation for more information on using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/):

   * For authentication, see [Sign in with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
   * If you need to create a new resource group, see [az group](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az_group_create).

2. Create a web app.

   For example, you can use the Azure CLI to create an Azure App Service web app with a Java runtime:

   ```bash copy
   az webapp create \
       --name MY_WEBAPP_NAME \
       --plan MY_APP_SERVICE_PLAN \
       --resource-group MY_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --runtime "JAVA|11-java11"
   ```

   In the command above, replace the parameters with your own values, where `MY_WEBAPP_NAME` is a new name for the web app.

3. Configure an Azure publish profile and create an `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` secret.

   Generate your Azure deployment credentials using a publish profile. For more information, see [Generate deployment credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel#generate-deployment-credentials) in the Azure documentation.

   In your GitHub repository, create a secret named `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` that contains the contents of the publish profile. For more information on creating secrets, see [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

4. Optionally, configure a deployment environment. Environments are used to describe a general deployment target like `production`, `staging`, or `development`. When a GitHub Actions workflow deploys to an environment, the environment is displayed on the main page of the repository. You can use environments to require approval for a job to proceed, restrict which branches can trigger a workflow, gate deployments with custom deployment protection rules, or limit access to secrets. For more information about creating environments, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/manage-environments).

## Creating the workflow

Once you've completed the prerequisites, you can proceed with creating the workflow.

The following example workflow demonstrates how to build and deploy a Java project to Azure App Service when there is a push to the `main` branch.

Ensure that you set `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME` in the workflow `env` key to the name of the web app you created. If you want to use a Java version other than `11`, change `JAVA_VERSION`.

If you configured a deployment environment, change the value of `environment` to be the name of your environment. If you did not configure an environment or if your workflow is in a private repository and you do not use GitHub Enterprise Cloud, delete the `environment` key.

```yaml copy
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.

name: Build and deploy JAR app to Azure Web App

env:
  AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME: MY_WEBAPP_NAME   # set this to your application's name
  JAVA_VERSION: '11'                  # set this to the Java version to use

          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}

```

* The action used to deploy the web app is the official Azure [`Azure/webapps-deploy`](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy) action.
