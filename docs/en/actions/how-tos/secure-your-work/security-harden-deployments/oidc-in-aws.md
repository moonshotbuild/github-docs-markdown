# Configuring OpenID Connect in Amazon Web Services

Use OpenID Connect within your workflows to authenticate with Amazon Web Services.

## Overview

OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows your GitHub Actions workflows to access resources in Amazon Web Services (AWS), without needing to store the AWS credentials as long-lived GitHub secrets.

This guide explains how to configure AWS to trust GitHub's OIDC as a federated identity, and includes a workflow example for the [`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) that uses tokens to authenticate to AWS and access resources.

> \[!NOTE]
> Support for custom claims for OIDC is unavailable in AWS.

## Prerequisites

* To learn the basic concepts of how GitHub uses OpenID Connect (OIDC), and its architecture and benefits, see [OpenID Connect](/en/actions/concepts/security/openid-connect).

* Before proceeding, you must plan your security strategy to ensure that access tokens are only allocated in a predictable way. To control how your cloud provider issues access tokens, you **must** define at least one condition, so that untrusted repositories can’t request access tokens for your cloud resources. For more information, see [OpenID Connect reference](/en/actions/reference/security/oidc#oidc-claims-used-to-define-trust-conditions-on-cloud-roles).

## Adding the identity provider to AWS

To add the GitHub OIDC provider to IAM, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html).

* For the provider URL: Use `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
* For the "Audience": Use `sts.amazonaws.com` if you are using the [official action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials).

### Configuring the role and trust policy

To configure the role and trust in IAM, see the AWS documentation [Configure AWS Credentials for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#configure-aws-credentials-for-github-actions) and [Configuring a role for GitHub OIDC identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create_GitHub).

> \[!NOTE]
> AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) recommends that users evaluate the IAM condition key, `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub`, in the trust policy of any role that trusts GitHub’s OIDC identity provider (IdP). Evaluating this condition key in the role trust policy limits which GitHub actions are able to assume the role.

Edit the trust policy, adding the `sub` field to the validation conditions. For example:

```json copy
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:octo-org/octo-repo:ref:refs/heads/octo-branch"
  }
}
```

For repositories created after July 15, 2026, or that have opted in to immutable subject claims, the `sub` claim includes immutable owner and repository IDs (not available on GitHub Enterprise Server). Make sure your trust policy matches the format your repository uses. For more information, see [OpenID Connect reference](/en/actions/reference/security/oidc#immutable-subject-claims).

```json copy
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:octo-org@123456/octo-repo@456789:ref:refs/heads/octo-branch"
  }
}
```

If you use a workflow with an environment, the `sub` field must reference the environment name: `repo:ORG-NAME/REPO-NAME:environment:ENVIRONMENT-NAME`. For more information, see [OpenID Connect reference](/en/actions/reference/security/oidc#filtering-for-a-specific-environment).

> \[!NOTE]
> When environments are used in workflows or in OIDC policies, we recommend adding protection rules to the environment for additional security. For example, you can configure deployment rules on an environment to restrict which branches and tags can deploy to the environment or access environment secrets. For more information, see [Managing environments for deployment](/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/manage-environments).

```json copy
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:octo-org/octo-repo:environment:prod"
  }
}
```

In the following example, `StringLike` is used with a wildcard operator (`*`) to allow any branch, pull request merge branch, or environment from the `octo-org/octo-repo` organization and repository to assume a role in AWS.

```json copy
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::123456123456:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:octo-org/octo-repo:*"
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Updating your GitHub Actions workflow

To update your workflows for OIDC, you will need to make two changes to your YAML:

1. Add permissions settings for the token.
2. Use the [`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) action to exchange the OIDC token (JWT) for a cloud access token.

### Adding permissions settings

The job or workflow run requires a `permissions` setting with [`id-token: write`](/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token) to allow GitHub's OIDC provider to create a JSON Web Token for every run.

> \[!NOTE] Setting `id-token: write` in the workflow’s permissions does not give the workflow permission to modify or write to any resources. Instead, it only allows the workflow to request (fetch) and use (set) an OIDC token for an action or step. This token is then used to authenticate with external services using a short-lived access token.

For detailed information on required permissions, configuration examples, and advanced scenarios, see [OpenID Connect reference](/en/actions/reference/security/oidc#workflow-permissions-for-the-requesting-the-oidc-token).

### Requesting the access token

The `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action receives a JWT from the GitHub OIDC provider, and then requests an access token from AWS. For more information, see the AWS [documentation](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials).

* `BUCKET-NAME`: Replace this with the name of your S3 bucket.
* `AWS-REGION`: Replace this with the name of your AWS region.
* `ROLE-TO-ASSUME`: Replace this with your AWS role. For example, `arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/example-role`
