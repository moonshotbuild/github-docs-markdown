# Creating workflow templates for your organization

Learn how you can create workflow templates to help people in your team add new workflows more easily.

## Creating workflow templates

This procedure demonstrates how to create a workflow template and metadata file. The metadata file describes how the workflow templates will be presented to users when they are creating a new workflow.

1. If it doesn't already exist, create a new  repository named `.github` in your organization.

2. Create a directory named `workflow-templates`.

3. Create your new workflow file inside the `workflow-templates` directory.

   If you need to refer to a repository's default branch, you can use the `$default-branch` placeholder. When a workflow is created the placeholder will be automatically replaced with the name of the repository's default branch.

   For example, this file named `octo-organization-ci.yml` demonstrates a basic workflow.

   ```yaml copy
   name: Octo Organization CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ $default-branch ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ $default-branch ]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v6

         - name: Run a one-line script
           run: echo Hello from Octo Organization
   ```

4. Create a metadata file inside the `workflow-templates` directory. The metadata file must have the same name as the workflow file, but instead of the `.yml` extension, it must be appended with `.properties.json`. For example, this file named `octo-organization-ci.properties.json` contains the metadata for a workflow file named `octo-organization-ci.yml`:

   ```json copy
   {
       "name": "Octo Organization Workflow",
       "description": "Octo Organization CI workflow template.",
       "iconName": "example-icon",
       "categories": [
           "Go"
       ],
       "filePatterns": [
           "package.json$",
           "^Dockerfile",
           ".*\\.md$"
       ]
   }
   ```

   * `name` - **Required.** The name of the workflow. This is displayed in the list of available workflows.
   * `description` - **Required.** The description of the workflow. This is displayed in the list of available workflows.
   * `iconName` - **Optional.** Specifies an icon for the workflow that is displayed in the list of workflows. `iconName` can be one of the following types:
     * An SVG file that is stored in the `workflow-templates` directory. To reference a file, the value must be the file name without the file extension. For example, an SVG file named `example-icon.svg` is referenced as `example-icon`.
     * An icon from GitHub's set of [Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/). To reference an octicon, the value must be `octicon <icon name>`. For example, `octicon smiley`.
   * `categories` - **Optional.** Defines the categories that the workflow is shown under. You can use category names from the following lists:
     * General category names from the [starter-workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/README.md#categories) repository.
     * Linguist languages from the list in the [linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) repository.
     * Supported tech stacks from the list in the [starter-workflows](https://github.com/github-starter-workflows/repo-analysis-partner/blob/main/tech_stacks.yml) repository.
   * `filePatterns` - **Optional.** Allows the workflow to be used if the user's repository has a file in its root directory that matches a defined regular expression.

5. To add another workflow template, add your files to the same `workflow-templates` directory.
