# Deploying to a specific environment

Specify a deployment environment in your workflow.

## Prerequisites

You need to create an environment before you can use it in a workflow. See [Managing environments for deployment](/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/manage-environments#creating-an-environment).

## Using an environment in a workflow

1. Open the workflow file you want to edit.

2. Use the following syntax to add a [`jobs.<job_id>.environment`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idenvironment) key to your workflow:

   ```yaml copy
   jobs:
     JOB-ID:
       environment: ENVIRONMENT-NAME
   ```

   The chosen job will now be subject to any rules configured for the specified environment.

3. Optionally, specify a deployment URL for the environment using the following syntax:

   ```yaml copy
   jobs:
     JOB-ID:
       environment:
           name: ENVIRONMENT-NAME
           url: URL
   ```

   The specified URL will appear:

   * On the deployments page for the repository
   * In the visualization graph for the workflow run
   * (If a pull request triggers the workflow) As a "View deployment" button in the pull request timeline

4. Optionally, prevent a deployment object from being created by adding the `deployment` property. When set to `false`, the job still has access to environment secrets and variables, but no GitHub deployment is created:

   ```yaml copy
   jobs:
     JOB-ID:
       environment:
           name: ENVIRONMENT-NAME
           deployment: false
   ```

   This is useful for CI or testing jobs that need environment secrets but aren't actually deploying anything. For more information, see [Deploying with GitHub Actions](/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/control-deployments#using-environments-without-deployments).
