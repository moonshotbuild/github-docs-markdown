# Using jobs in a workflow

Use workflows to run multiple jobs.

## Prerequisites

To implement jobs in your workflows, you need to understand what jobs are. See [Understanding GitHub Actions](/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions#jobs).

## Setting an ID for a job

Use `jobs.<job_id>` to give your job a unique identifier. The key `job_id` is a string and its value is a map of the job's configuration data. You must replace `<job_id>` with a string that is unique to the `jobs` object. The `<job_id>` must start with a letter or `_` and contain only alphanumeric characters, `-`, or `_`.

### Example: Creating jobs

In this example, two jobs have been created, and their `job_id` values are `my_first_job` and `my_second_job`.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_first_job:
    name: My first job
  my_second_job:
    name: My second job
```

## Setting a name for a job

Use `jobs.<job_id>.name` to set a name for the job, which is displayed in the GitHub UI.

## Defining prerequisite jobs

Use `jobs.<job_id>.needs` to identify any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run. It can be a string or array of strings. If a job fails or is skipped, all jobs that need it are skipped unless the jobs use a conditional expression that causes the job to continue. If a run contains a series of jobs that need each other, a failure or skip applies to all jobs in the dependency chain from the point of failure or skip onwards. If you would like a job to run even if a job it is dependent on did not succeed, use the `always()` conditional expression in `jobs.<job_id>.if`.

### Example: Requiring successful dependent jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    needs: [job1, job2]
```

In this example, `job1` must complete successfully before `job2` begins, and `job3` waits for both `job1` and `job2` to complete.

The jobs in this example run sequentially:

1. `job1`
2. `job2`
3. `job3`

### Example: Not requiring successful dependent jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    if: ${{ always() }}
    needs: [job1, job2]
```

In this example, `job3` uses the `always()` conditional expression so that it always runs after `job1` and `job2` have completed, regardless of whether they were successful. For more information, see [Evaluate expressions in workflows and actions](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/expressions#status-check-functions).

## Using a matrix to run jobs with different variables

To automatically run a job with different combinations of variables, such as operating systems or language versions, define a `matrix` strategy in your workflow.

For more information, see [Running variations of jobs in a workflow](/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations).
