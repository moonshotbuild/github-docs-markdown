# Setting a default shell and working directory

Define the default settings that will apply to all jobs in the workflow, or all steps in a job.

## Overview

Use `defaults` to create a `map` of default settings that will apply to all jobs in the workflow. You can also set default settings that are only available to a job. For more information, see [`jobs.<job_id>.defaults`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_iddefaults).

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.

## Setting default shell and working directory

You can use `defaults.run` to provide default `shell` and `working-directory` options for all [`run`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idstepsrun) steps in a workflow. You can also set default settings for `run` that are only available to a job. For more information, see [`jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_iddefaultsrun). You cannot use contexts or expressions in this keyword.

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.

### Example: Set the default shell and working directory

```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash
    working-directory: ./scripts
```

## Setting default values for a specific job

Use `jobs.<job_id>.defaults` to create a `map` of default settings that will apply to all steps in the job. You can also set default settings for the entire workflow. For more information, see [`defaults`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#defaults).

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.

## Setting default shell and working directory for a job

Use `jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run` to provide default `shell` and `working-directory` to all `run` steps in the job.

You can provide default `shell` and `working-directory` options for all [`run`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idstepsrun) steps in a job. You can also set default settings for `run` for the entire workflow. For more information, see [`defaults.run`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#defaultsrun).

These can be overridden at the `jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run` and `jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].run` levels.

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.

### Example: Setting default `run` step options for a job

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        shell: bash
        working-directory: ./scripts
```
