# Adding scripts to your workflow

You can use GitHub Actions workflows to run scripts.

You can use a GitHub Actions workflow to run scripts and shell commands, which are then executed on the assigned runner. This example demonstrates how to use the `run` keyword to execute the command `npm install -g bats` on the runner.

```yaml
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm install -g bats
```

To use a workflow to run a script stored in your repository you must first check out the repository to the runner. Having done this, you can use the `run` keyword to run the script on the runner. The following example runs two scripts, each in a separate job step. The location of the scripts on the runner is specified by setting a default working directory for run commands. For more information, see [Setting a default shell and working directory](/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/set-default-values-for-jobs).

```yaml
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./scripts
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repository to the runner
        uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - name: Run a script
        run: ./my-script.sh
      - name: Run another script
        run: ./my-other-script.sh
```

Any scripts that you want a workflow job to run must be executable. You can do this either within the workflow by passing the script as an argument to the interpreter that will run the script - for example, `run: bash script.sh` - or by making the file itself executable. You can give the file the execute permission by using the command `git update-index --chmod=+x PATH/TO/YOUR/script.sh` locally, then committing and pushing the file to the repository. Alternatively, for workflows that are run on Linux and Mac runners, you can add a command to give the file the execute permission in the workflow job, prior to running the script:

```yaml
jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./scripts
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repository to the runner
        uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - name: Make the script files executable
        run: chmod +x my-script.sh my-other-script.sh
      - name: Run the scripts
        run: |
          ./my-script.sh
          ./my-other-script.sh
```

For more information about the `run` keyword, see [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idstepsrun).
