# Control the concurrency of workflows and jobs

Manage which workflows and jobs can run simultaneously.

## Using concurrency in different scenarios

You can use `jobs.<job_id>.concurrency` to ensure that only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group will run at a time. A concurrency group can be any string or expression. Allowed expression contexts: [`github`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts#github-context), [`inputs`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts#inputs-context), [`vars`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts#vars-context), [`needs`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts#needs-context), [`strategy`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts#strategy-context), and [`matrix`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts#matrix-context). For more information about expressions, see [Evaluate expressions in workflows and actions](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/expressions).

You can also specify `concurrency` at the workflow level. For more information, see [`concurrency`](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#concurrency).

This means that there can be at most one running job or workflow in a concurrency group at any time. When a concurrent job or workflow is queued, if another job or workflow using the same concurrency group in the repository is in progress, the queued job or workflow will be `pending`. By default, any existing `pending` job or workflow in the same concurrency group will be canceled and the new queued job or workflow will take its place.

To also cancel any currently running job or workflow in the same concurrency group, specify `cancel-in-progress: true`. To conditionally cancel currently running jobs or workflows in the same concurrency group, you can specify `cancel-in-progress` as an expression with any of the allowed expression contexts.

To allow more than one `pending` job or workflow run to wait in the same concurrency group, use the optional `queue` property. The `queue` property accepts the following values:

* `single` (default): At most one job or workflow run can be `pending` in the concurrency group. When a new job or workflow run is queued, any existing `pending` job or workflow run in the same group is canceled and replaced.
* `max`: Up to 100 jobs or workflow runs can be `pending` in the concurrency group. When the queue is full, any additional jobs or workflow runs are canceled.

The combination of `queue: max` and `cancel-in-progress: true` is not allowed and will result in a workflow validation error.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> * The concurrency group name is case insensitive. For example, `prod` and `Prod` will be treated as the same concurrency group.
> * Jobs or workflow runs in the same concurrency group are processed in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order according to the time each one started waiting on the concurrency group, not the time each workflow was dispatched. Since the actual start time of a job or run may vary, ordering is not guaranteed.

### Example: Using concurrency and the default behavior

The default behavior of GitHub Actions is to allow multiple jobs or workflow runs to run concurrently. The `concurrency` keyword allows you to control the concurrency of workflow runs.

For example, you can use the `concurrency` keyword immediately after where trigger conditions are defined to limit the concurrency of entire workflow runs for a specific branch:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

You can also limit the concurrency of jobs within a workflow by using the `concurrency` keyword at the job level:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  job-1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: example-group
      cancel-in-progress: true
```

### Example: Concurrency groups

Concurrency groups provide a way to manage and limit the execution of workflow runs or jobs that share the same concurrency key.

The `concurrency` key is used to group workflows or jobs together into a concurrency group. When you define a `concurrency` key, GitHub Actions ensures that only one workflow or job with that key runs at any given time. If a new workflow run or job starts with the same `concurrency` key, GitHub Actions will cancel any workflow or job already running with that key. The `concurrency` key can be a hard-coded string, or it can be a dynamic expression that includes context variables.

It is possible to define concurrency conditions in your workflow so that the workflow or job is part of a concurrency group.

This means that when a workflow run or job starts, GitHub will cancel any workflow runs or jobs that are already in progress in the same concurrency group. This is useful in scenarios where you want to prevent parallel runs for a certain set of a workflows or jobs, such as the ones used for deployments to a staging environment, in order to prevent actions that could cause conflicts or consume more resources than necessary.

In this example, `job-1` is part of a concurrency group named `staging_environment`. This means that if a new run of `job-1` is triggered, any runs of the same job in the `staging_environment` concurrency group that are already in progress will be cancelled.

```yaml
jobs:
  job-1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: staging_environment
      cancel-in-progress: true
```

Alternatively, using a dynamic expression such as `concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}` in your workflow means that the workflow or job would be part of a concurrency group named `ci-` followed by the reference of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow. In this example, if a new commit is pushed to the main branch while a previous run is still in progress, the previous run will be cancelled and the new one will start:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### Example: Queueing multiple pending runs

By default, only one job or workflow run can be `pending` in a concurrency group at a time. To allow multiple runs to queue instead of being canceled, set `queue: max`. With `queue: max`, up to 100 jobs or workflow runs can wait in the concurrency group; once the queue is full, any additional runs are canceled.

For example, the following workflow queues deployments to the `production` environment, processing them one at a time in order based on when each run started waiting on the concurrency group:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: production-deploy
  queue: max
```

Note that `queue: max` cannot be combined with `cancel-in-progress: true`, because the two options describe conflicting behaviors for handling in-progress runs.

### Example: Using concurrency to cancel any in-progress job or run

To use concurrency to cancel any in-progress job or run in GitHub Actions, you can use the `concurrency` key with the `cancel-in-progress` option set to `true`:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

Note that in this example, without defining a particular concurrency group, GitHub Actions will cancel *any* in-progress run of the job or workflow.

### Example: Using a fallback value

If you build the group name with a property that is only defined for specific events, you can use a fallback value. For example, `github.head_ref` is only defined on `pull_request` events. If your workflow responds to other events in addition to `pull_request` events, you will need to provide a fallback to avoid a syntax error. The following concurrency group cancels in-progress jobs or runs on `pull_request` events only; if `github.head_ref` is undefined, the concurrency group will fallback to the run ID, which is guaranteed to be both unique and defined for the run.

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.head_ref || github.run_id }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### Example: Only cancel in-progress jobs or runs for the current workflow

If you have multiple workflows in the same repository, concurrency group names must be unique across workflows to avoid canceling in-progress jobs or runs from other workflows. Otherwise, any previously in-progress or pending job will be canceled, regardless of the workflow.

To only cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow, you can use the `github.workflow` property to build the concurrency group:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### Example: Only cancel in-progress jobs on specific branches

If you would like to cancel in-progress jobs on certain branches but not on others, you can use conditional expressions with `cancel-in-progress`. For example, you can do this if you would like to cancel in-progress jobs on development branches but not on release branches.

To only cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow when not running on a release branch, you can set `cancel-in-progress` to an expression similar to the following:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ !contains(github.ref, 'release/')}}
```

In this example, multiple pushes to a `release/1.2.3` branch would not cancel in-progress runs. Pushes to another branch, such as `main`, would cancel in-progress runs.

## Monitoring your current jobs in your organization or enterprise

To identify any constraints with concurrency or queuing, you can check how many jobs are currently being processed on the GitHub-hosted runners in your organization or enterprise. For more information, see [Viewing your current jobs](/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/github-hosted-runners/view-current-jobs).
