# Installing your own GitHub App

You can install a GitHub App that you created on the account that owns the app. If your app is public, the GitHub App can also be installed on other accounts.

## About installing your own GitHub App

After creating a GitHub App, you can install it based on its visibility.

* **Only on this account:** The GitHub App can only be installed on the account that created it.
* **Any account:** You can install this GitHub App on any account you control.

## Installing your own GitHub App

1. Navigate to your account settings.

     1. Click **Your organizations**.
