# Inviting users to join your organization

You can invite anyone to become a member of your organization using their username or email address for GitHub.

> \[!NOTE] This article does not apply to Enterprise Managed Users. Managed user accounts are provisioned using SCIM, not invited.

## About organization invitations

When you invite someone to become a member of your organization, the person receives an email with an invitation link. To join the organization, the invitee clicks the invitation link in the email.

You can use a person's GitHub username or email address for the invitation.

> \[!NOTE]
> If you use an email address for the invitation, the invitee will only be able to accept the invitation if the email address matches with a verified email address associated with the invitee's personal account on GitHub. For more information, see [Verifying your email address](/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address).
>
> If an invitee's personal account has been flagged, the invitee won't be able to accept any new or pending invitations to join organizations.

If your organization has a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can invite a new member to join the organization or reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see [People who consume a license in an organization](/en/billing/reference/github-license-users).

If an invitee does not accept the invitation within seven days, the pending invitation expires automatically.

If your organization requires members to use two-factor authentication, users that you invite must enable two-factor authentication before accepting the invitation. For more information, see [Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization](/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization) and [Securing your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)](/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can implement SCIM to add, manage, and remove organization members' access to GitHub through an identity provider (IdP). For more information, see [About SCIM for organizations](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-scim-for-organizations)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

To prevent abuse, you can only create 50 organization invitations within a 24-hour period. If your organization is more than one month old or on a paid plan, the limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour period.
