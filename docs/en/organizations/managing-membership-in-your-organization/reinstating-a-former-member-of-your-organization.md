# Reinstating a former member of your organization

You can add former members to your organization, and choose whether to restore the person's former role, access permissions, forks, and settings.

## About member reinstatement

If a user is removed from your organization in one of the following ways, the user's access privileges and settings are saved for three months.

* You manually removed the user from your organization. For more information, see [Removing a member from your organization](/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/removing-a-member-from-your-organization).
* The user was removed from your organization because you've required members and outside collaborators to enable two-factor authentication (2FA). For more information, see [Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization](/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization).
* The user was removed from your organization because you enforced SAML single sign-on. For more information, see [Enforcing SAML single sign-on for your organization](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/enforcing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.
* You converted an organization member to an outside collaborator. For more information, see [Converting an organization member to an outside collaborator](/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-outside-collaborators/converting-an-organization-member-to-an-outside-collaborator).

You can restore the user's privileges if you invite them back to the organization within that time frame.

If your organization has a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see [People who consume a license in an organization](/en/billing/reference/github-license-users).

## Items that are restored for reinstated members

When you reinstate a former organization member, the following items can be restored:

* The user's role in the organization
* Any private forks of repositories owned by the organization
* Membership in the organization's teams
* Previous access and permissions for the organization's repositories
* Stars for organization repositories
* Issue assignments in the organization
* Repository subscriptions (notification settings for watching, not watching, or ignoring a repository's activity)

## Reinstating a former member of your organization on GitHub

If a user was removed from your organization because you required members and outside collaborators to enable 2FA, you can send an invitation to reinstate a user's privileges and access to the organization before they have enabled two-factor authentication, but they must enable 2FA before they can accept your invitation to rejoin the organization.
