# Creating an organization team

You can create independent or nested teams to manage repository permissions and mentions for groups of people.

Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can use team synchronization to automatically add and remove organization members to teams through an identity provider. For more information, see [Synchronizing a team with an identity provider group](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.
