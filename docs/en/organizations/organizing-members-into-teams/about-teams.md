# About organization teams

Teams are groups of organization members that reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions.

## About teams

You can use teams to manage access for people in an organization, and for sending notifications. Organization owners and team maintainers can give teams admin, read, or write access to organization repositories. Organization members can send a notification to an entire team by mentioning the team's name. Teams can only be made up of members of your organization, outside collaborators are unable to be on a team.

> \[!TIP]
> If you use an enterprise account, you can also create teams at the enterprise level. For more information, see [Teams in an enterprise](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/concepts/enterprise-fundamentals/teams-in-an-enterprise).

Organization members can send a notification to an entire team by requesting a review from that team. Organization members can request reviews from specific teams with read access to the repository where the pull request is opened. Teams can be designated as owners of certain types or areas of code in a CODEOWNERS file.

For more information, see:

* [Managing team access to an organization repository](/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)
* [Basic writing and formatting syntax](/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams)
* [About code owners](/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)

Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can use team synchronization to automatically add and remove organization members to teams through an identity provider. For more information, see [Synchronizing a team with an identity provider group](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

## Team visibility

Teams can be visible or secret:

* Visible teams can be [viewed and @mentioned](/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) by every organization member.
* Secret teams are only visible to the people on the team and organization owners. They're great for hiding the members of teams that work with external partners or clients. However, if a team member or organization owner mentions a secret team, the team name is visible in the mention text. Secret teams cannot be nested under parent teams or have child teams.

People who are not members of the organization cannot view any teams.

You can view all the teams you belong to on your personal dashboard. For more information, see [Quickstart for your personal dashboard](/en/account-and-profile/get-started/personal-dashboard-quickstart#finding-your-top-repositories-and-teams).

## Team pages

Each team has its own page within an organization. On a team's page, you can view team members, child teams, and the team's repositories. Organization owners and team maintainers can access team settings and update the team's description and profile picture from the team's page.

> \[!NOTE]
> Team Discussions are retired. You can read more about this on the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-08-sunset-notice-team-discussions/).

> You can use GitHub Discussions to create organization-level discussions. For more information about GitHub Discussions, see [GitHub Discussions documentation](/en/discussions).

## Nested teams

You can reflect your group or company's hierarchy within your GitHub organization with multiple levels of nested teams. A parent team can have multiple child teams, while each child team only has one parent team. You cannot nest secret teams. Each nested team functions as a distinct entity with its own unique URL and directory within your organization.

Child teams inherit the parent's access permissions, simplifying permissions management for large groups. Members of child teams also receive notifications when the parent team is @mentioned, simplifying communication with multiple groups of people.

For example, if your team structure is Employees > Engineering > Application Engineering > Identity, granting Engineering write access to a repository means Application Engineering and Identity also get that access. If you @mention the Identity Team or any team at the bottom of the organization hierarchy, they're the only ones who will receive a notification. When mentioning a team, you do not need to include the full hierarchical path. Even though a team is nested, it retains a flat handle for mentions.

To easily understand who shares a parent team's permissions and mentions, you can see all of the members of a parent team's child teams on the Members tab of the parent team's page. Members of a child team are not direct members of the parent team.

You can choose a parent when you create the team, or you can move a team in your organization's hierarchy later. For more information see, [Moving a team in your organization's hierarchy](/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/moving-a-team-in-your-organizations-hierarchy).

## Preparing to nest teams in your organization

If your organization already has existing teams, you should audit each team's repository access permissions before you nest teams above or below it. You should also consider the new structure you'd like to implement for your organization.

At the top of the team hierarchy, you should give parent teams repository access permissions that are safe for every member of the parent team and its child teams. As you move toward the bottom of the hierarchy, you can grant child teams additional, more granular access to more sensitive repositories.

1. Remove all members from existing teams
2. Audit and adjust each team's repository access permissions and give each team a parent
3. Create any new teams you'd like to, choose a parent for each new team, and give them repository access
4. Add people directly to teams
