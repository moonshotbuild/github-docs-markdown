# Register a learning management system with GitHub Classroom

You can configure an LTI-compliant learning management system (LMS) with GitHub Classroom.

> \[!WARNING]
> **Closing down:** The GitHub Classroom application is closing down and will be retired on August 28, 2026.
> For more information, see the [GitHub Classroom closing down notice](https://gh.io/classroom-sunset).

## About registering an LMS to your classroom

Before you can connect your LMS to a classroom, an administrator for your LMS instance needs to configure your LMS to allow GitHub Classroom and then register your LMS with GitHub Classroom to initiate the OAuth handshake. An admin only needs to do this registration process once, then any teacher who uses their LMS instance may sync their LMS courses to classrooms. For more information on connecting an LMS course to a classroom, see [Connect a learning management system course to a classroom](/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/connect-a-learning-management-system-course-to-a-classroom).

> \[!NOTE]
> Google Classroom does not use the LTI protocol, so does not need to be connected to GitHub Classroom before importing the roster. For more information, see [Connect a learning management system course to a classroom](/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/connect-a-learning-management-system-course-to-a-classroom#importing-a-roster-from-google-classroom).

## Supported LMSes

GitHub Classroom supports connecting with LMSes that implement Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards.

* LTI version 1.3
* LTI Advantage

Using LTI helps keep your information safe and secure. LTI is an industry-standard protocol and GitHub Classroom's use of LTI is certified by the Instructional Management System (IMS) Global Learning Consortium. For more information, see [Learning Tools Interoperability](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) and [About IMS Global Learning Consortium](https://www.imsglobal.org/aboutims.html) on the IMS Global Learning Consortium website.

GitHub has tested and verified registration, connection and the import of roster data from the following LMSes into GitHub Classroom.

* Blackboard (This is a community supported option)
* Canvas
* Moodle
* Sakai
* Google Classroom

> \[!NOTE]
> Other LMSes that implement LTI 1.3 may also work with GitHub Classroom, but have not yet been verified. LMS admins may need to configure custom settings around privacy and button placement and may need to provide teachers with documentation on how to launch into GitHub Classroom from the LMS.

Google Classroom does not use the LTI protocol, so does not need to be connected to GitHub Classroom before importing the roster. For more information, see [Connect a learning management system course to a classroom](/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/connect-a-learning-management-system-course-to-a-classroom#importing-a-roster-from-google-classroom).
