# Working with the Docker registry

You can push and pull your Docker images using the GitHub Packages Docker registry.

<!-- Main versioning block. Short page for dotcom -->

GitHub's Docker registry (which used the namespace `docker.pkg.github.com`) has been replaced by the Container registry (which uses the namespace `https://ghcr.io`). The Container registry offers benefits such as granular permissions and storage optimizations for Docker images.

Docker images previously stored in the Docker registry are being automatically migrated into the Container registry. For more information, see [Migrating to the Container registry from the Docker registry](/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/migrating-to-the-container-registry-from-the-docker-registry) and [Working with the Container registry](/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).
