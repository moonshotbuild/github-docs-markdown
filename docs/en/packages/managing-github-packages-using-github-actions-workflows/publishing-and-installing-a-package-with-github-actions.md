# Publishing and installing a package with GitHub Actions

You can configure a workflow in GitHub Actions to automatically publish or install a package from GitHub Packages.

## About GitHub Packages with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions help you automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow. With GitHub Actions you can build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in your repository. For more information, see [Writing workflows](/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows).

You can extend the CI and CD capabilities of your repository by publishing or installing packages as part of your workflow.

### Authenticating to package registries with granular permissions

Some GitHub Packages registries support granular permissions. This means you can choose to allow packages to be scoped to a user or an organization, or linked to a repository. For the list of registries that support granular permissions, see [About permissions for GitHub Packages](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages).

For registries that support granular permissions, if your GitHub Actions workflow is using a personal access token to authenticate to a registry, we highly recommend you update your workflow to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. For guidance on updating your workflows that authenticate to a registry with a personal access token, see [Publishing and installing a package with GitHub Actions](/en/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows/publishing-and-installing-a-package-with-github-actions#upgrading-a-workflow-that-accesses-a-registry-using-a-personal-access-token).

> \[!NOTE]
> The ability for GitHub Actions workflows to delete and restore packages using the REST API is currently in public preview and subject to change.

You can use a `GITHUB_TOKEN` in a GitHub Actions workflow to delete or restore a package using the REST API, if the token has `admin` permission to the package. Repositories that publish packages using a workflow, and repositories that you have explicitly connected to packages, are automatically granted `admin` permission to packages in the repository.

For more information about the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, see [Use GITHUB\_TOKEN for authentication in workflows](/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow). For more information about the best practices when using a registry in actions, see [Compromised runners](/en/actions/concepts/security/compromised-runners#cross-repository-access).

### Authenticating to package registries with repository-scoped permissions

Some GitHub Packages registries only support repository-scoped permissions, and do not support granular permissions. For a list of these registries, see [About permissions for GitHub Packages](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages).

If you want your workflow to access a GitHub Packages registry that does not support granular permissions, then we recommend using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that GitHub automatically creates for your repository when you enable GitHub Actions. You should set the permissions for this access token in the workflow file to grant read access for the `contents` scope and write access for the `packages` scope. For forks, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is granted read access for the parent repository. For more information, see [Use GITHUB\_TOKEN for authentication in workflows](/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token).

You can reference the `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your workflow file using the `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` context. For more information, see [Use GITHUB\_TOKEN for authentication in workflows](/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token).

## About permissions and package access

### Packages scoped to users or organizations

Registries that support granular permissions allow users to create and administer packages as free-standing resources at the organization level. Packages can be scoped to an organization or personal account and you can customize access to each of your packages separately from repository permissions.

All workflows accessing registries that support granular permissions should use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of a personal access token. For more information about security best practices, see [Secure use reference](/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use#use-secrets-for-sensitive-information).

### Packages scoped to repositories

When you enable GitHub Actions, GitHub installs a GitHub App on your repository. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is a GitHub App installation access token. You can use the installation access token to authenticate on behalf of the GitHub App installed on your repository. The token's permissions are limited to the repository that contains your workflow. For more information, see [Use GITHUB\_TOKEN for authentication in workflows](/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token#about-the-github_token-secret).

GitHub Packages allows you to push and pull packages through the `GITHUB_TOKEN` available to a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Default permissions and access settings for packages modified through workflows

For packages in registries that support granular permissions, when you create, install, modify, or delete a package through a workflow, there are some default permission and access settings used to ensure admins have access to the workflow. You can adjust these access settings as well. For the list of registries that support granular permissions, see [About permissions for GitHub Packages](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages).

For example, by default if a workflow creates a package using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, then:

* The package inherits the visibility and permissions model of the repository where the workflow is run.
* Repository admins where the workflow is run become the admins of the package once the package is created.

These are more examples of how default permissions work for workflows that manage packages.

You can also adjust access to packages in a more granular way or adjust some of the default permissions behavior. For more information, see [Configuring a package's access control and visibility](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility).

## Publishing a package using an action

You can use GitHub Actions to automatically publish packages as part of your continuous integration (CI) flow. This approach to continuous deployment (CD) allows you to automate the creation of new package versions, if the code meets your quality standards. For example, you could create a workflow that runs CI tests every time a developer pushes code to a particular branch. If the tests pass, the workflow can publish a new package version to GitHub Packages.

Configuration steps vary by package client. For general information about configuring a workflow for GitHub Actions, see [Writing workflows](/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows).

The following example demonstrates how you can use GitHub Actions to build  your app, and then automatically create a Docker image and publish it to GitHub Packages. The relevant settings are explained in the code. For full details about each element in a workflow, see [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax).

Create a new workflow file in your repository (such as `.github/workflows/deploy-image.yml`), and add the following YAML.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> * This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub. They are provided by a third-party and are governed by separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support documentation.
> * GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA. To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA. You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.

```yaml annotate copy
#

# Configures this workflow to run every time a change is pushed to the branch called `release`.

  push:
    branches: ['release']

# Defines two custom environment variables for the workflow. These are used for the Container registry domain, and a name for the Docker image that this workflow builds.

      # This step uses [docker/metadata-action](https://github.com/docker/metadata-action#about) to extract tags and labels that will be applied to the specified image. The `id` "meta" allows the output of this step to be referenced in a subsequent step. The `images` value provides the base name for the tags and labels.
      - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels) for Docker
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@9ec57ed1fcdbf14dcef7dfbe97b2010124a938b7

      # This step uses the `docker/build-push-action` action to build the image, based on your repository's `Dockerfile`. If the build succeeds, it pushes the image to GitHub Packages.
      # It uses the `context` parameter to define the build's context as the set of files located in the specified path. For more information, see [Usage](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action#usage) in the README of the `docker/build-push-action` repository.
      # It uses the `tags` and `labels` parameters to tag and label the image with the output from the "meta" step.
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        id: push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@f2a1d5e99d037542a71f64918e516c093c6f3fc4
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
      
      # This step generates an artifact attestation for the image, which is an unforgeable statement about where and how it was built. It increases supply chain security for people who consume the image. For more information, see [Using artifact attestations to establish provenance for builds](/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).
      - name: Generate artifact attestation
        uses: actions/attest@v4
        with:
          subject-name: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME}}
          subject-digest: ${{ steps.push.outputs.digest }}
          push-to-registry: true
      
```

This new workflow will run automatically every time you push a change to a branch named `release` in the repository. You can view the progress in the **Actions** tab.

A few minutes after the workflow has completed, the new package will be visible in your repository. To find your available packages, see [Viewing packages](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/viewing-packages#viewing-a-repositorys-packages).

## Installing a package using an action

You can install packages as part of your CI flow using GitHub Actions. For example, you could configure a workflow so that anytime a developer pushes code to a pull request, the workflow resolves dependencies by downloading and installing packages hosted by GitHub Packages. Then, the workflow can run CI tests that require the dependencies.

Installing packages hosted by GitHub Packages through GitHub Actions requires minimal configuration or additional authentication when you use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Data transfer is also free when an action installs a package. For more information, see [GitHub Packages billing](/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-packages).

Configuration steps vary by package client. For general information about configuring a workflow for GitHub Actions, see [Writing workflows](/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows).

## Upgrading a workflow that accesses a registry using a personal access token

GitHub Packages supports the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for easy and secure authentication in your workflows. If you're using a registry that supports granular permissions, and your workflow is using a personal access token to authenticate to the registry, then we highly recommend you update your workflow to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

For more information about the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, see [Use GITHUB\_TOKEN for authentication in workflows](/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow).

Using the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, instead of a personal access token (classic) with the `repo` scope, increases the security of your repository as you don't need to use a long-lived personal access token that offers unnecessary access to the repository where your workflow is run. For more information about security best practices, see [Secure use reference](/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use#use-secrets-for-sensitive-information).

1. Navigate to your package landing page.

2. To ensure your package has access to your workflow, you must add the repository where the workflow is stored to your package. Under "Manage Actions access", click **Add repository** and search for the repository you want to add.
   ![Screenshot of the "Manage Actions access" section of the package settings page. The "Add repository" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/package-registry/add-repository-button.png)

   > \[!NOTE]
   > Adding a repository to your package by using the **Add Repository** button under "Manage Actions access" in the package's settings is different than connecting your package to a repository. For more information, see [Configuring a package's access control and visibility](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility#ensuring-workflow-access-to-your-package) and [Connecting a repository to a package](/en/packages/learn-github-packages/connecting-a-repository-to-a-package).

3. Optionally, use the **Role** drop-down menu to select the default access level that you'd like the repository to have to your package.

4. Open your workflow file. On the line where you log in to the registry, replace your personal access token with `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.

For example, this workflow publishes a Docker image to the Container registry and uses `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to authenticate. For more information, see [Set up Automated Builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) in the Docker documentation.
