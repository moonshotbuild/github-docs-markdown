# About single select fields

You can create single select fields with multiple options, each with a description and a color, that can be selected from a dropdown menu.

You can filter by your single select fields by specifying the option, for example: `fieldname:option`. You can filter for multiple values by providing a comma-separated list of options, for example: `fieldname:option,option`. For more information, see [Filtering projects](/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/filtering-projects).

Single select fields can contain up to 50 options.

## Adding a single select field

1. In table view, in the rightmost field header, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="Add field" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg>.

5. Below "Options", type the first option.
   * To add additional options, click **Add option**.
6. Click **Save**.

## Setting a default value

Choose an existing option as the default value for a single select field. New items added to the project are automatically pre-populated with that option.

1. Access your project's settings.
2. Click the name of the single select field to configure.
3. In the list of options, select the option to use as the default.
4. Click **Save**.

To remove a default value, deselect the currently selected default option, then click **Save**. Removing a default value does not affect existing items in the project.
