# About date fields

You can create custom date fields that can be set by typing a date or using a calendar.

You can filter for date values using the `YYYY-MM-DD` format, for example: `date:2022-07-01`. You can also use operators, such as `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `..`. For example, `date:>2022-07-01` and `date:2022-07-01..2022-07-31`. You can also provide `@today` to represent the current day in your filter. For more information, see [Filtering projects](/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/filtering-projects).

If your project makes use of date fields, you can use the roadmap layout to view items on a timeline. For more information, see [Changing the layout of a view](/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view) and [Customizing the roadmap layout](/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-roadmap-layout).

> \[!NOTE]
> Date fields do not currently support default values.
