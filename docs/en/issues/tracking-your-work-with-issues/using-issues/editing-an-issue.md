## Editing an issue with GitHub CLI

GitHub CLI is an open source tool for using GitHub from your computer's command line. When you're working from the command line, you can use the GitHub CLI to save time and avoid switching context. To learn more about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

### Editing a single issue

To edit an issue, use the `gh issue edit` subcommand with the issue number or URL.

```shell
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER --title "TITLE" --body "ISSUE-DESCRIPTION"
```

### Editing multiple issues

You can pass multiple issue numbers to apply the same change to several issues at once.

```shell
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER-1 ISSUE-NUMBER-2 --add-label "LABEL"
```

### Editing the issue type

To set or remove the issue type, use the `--type` or `--remove-type` flag.

```shell
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER --type "ISSUE-TYPE"
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER --remove-type
```

### Editing the parent issue

To set or remove the parent issue, use the `--parent` or `--remove-parent` flag. The parent can be specified by issue number or URL.

```shell
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER --parent PARENT-ISSUE-NUMBER
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER --remove-parent
```

### Editing sub-issues

To add or remove sub-issues, use the `--add-sub-issue` or `--remove-sub-issue` flag with a comma-separated list of issue numbers or URLs.

```shell
gh issue edit PARENT-ISSUE-NUMBER --add-sub-issue SUB-ISSUE-NUMBER
gh issue edit PARENT-ISSUE-NUMBER --remove-sub-issue SUB-ISSUE-NUMBER
```

### Editing dependencies

To manage dependencies, use the `--add-blocked-by`, `--remove-blocked-by`, `--add-blocking`, and `--remove-blocking` flags. Each accepts a comma-separated list of issue numbers or URLs.

```shell
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER --add-blocked-by BLOCKED-BY-ISSUE-NUMBER --add-blocking BLOCKING-ISSUE-NUMBER
```
