# Browsing sub-issues

Learn how to navigate issue hierarchy in your repositories.

You can add sub-issues to an issue to quickly break down larger pieces of work into smaller issues. Sub-issues add support for hierarchies of issues on GitHub by creating relationships between your issues. You can create multiple levels of sub-issues that accurately represent your project by breaking down tasks into exactly the amount of detail that you and your team require.

## Navigating issue hierarchy

You can browse through all levels of sub-issues from the parent issue.

1. Navigate to the parent issue.
2. To view the sub-issues under another sub-issue, click the expand toggle (<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-triangle-right" aria-label="triangle-right" role="img"><path d="m6.427 4.427 3.396 3.396a.25.25 0 0 1 0 .354l-3.396 3.396A.25.25 0 0 1 6 11.396V4.604a.25.25 0 0 1 .427-.177Z"></path></svg>).

## Finding a sub-issue's parent issue

When you view a sub-issue, you can always find a link back to the parent issue in the header below the issue title.

## Using sub-issues in your projects

You can add sub-issues to your projects and make use of the hierarchy data for building views, grouping items, and filtering your views. See [About parent issue and sub-issue progress fields](/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields/about-parent-issue-and-sub-issue-progress-fields).

## Browsing issue hierarchy with GitHub CLI

GitHub CLI is an open source tool for using GitHub from your computer's command line. When you're working from the command line, you can use the GitHub CLI to save time and avoid switching context. To learn more about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

To view a parent issue along with its sub-issues, use the `gh issue view` subcommand.

```shell
gh issue view ISSUE-NUMBER
```

The output includes the parent reference (if any) and a "Sub-issues" section that lists each sub-issue with its state and completion progress.

To get the same information in a machine-readable form, use the `--json` flag with the `parent`, `subIssues`, and `subIssuesSummary` fields.

```shell
gh issue view ISSUE-NUMBER --json parent,subIssues,subIssuesSummary
```
