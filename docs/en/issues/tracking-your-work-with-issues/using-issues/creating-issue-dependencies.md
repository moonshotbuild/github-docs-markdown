# Creating issue dependencies

Learn how to create issue dependencies so that you can see which issues are blocked by, or blocking, other work.

Issue dependencies let you define issues that are blocked by, or blocking, other work.

## Marking an issue as blocked by, or blocking, another issue

1. Navigate to the issue that you want to create a dependency for.
2. In the right sidebar, click **Relationships**.
3. From the dropdown, select a dependency option:
   * To indicate that your issue depends on another issue being completed, select **Mark as blocked by**.
   * To indicate that your issue is preventing another issue from being completed, select **Mark as blocking**.
4. In the dialog box that opens, search for and select all the issues that are blocked by, or blocking, your issue.

Blocked issues are marked with a "Blocked" icon on your project boards or repository's Issues page, so you can easily identify bottlenecks.

## Removing a blocking relationship between two issues

1. Navigate to the issue that you want to remove a dependency from.
2. In the right sidebar, click **Relationships**.
3. From the dropdown, select a dependency option:
   * To indicate that your issue no longer depends on another issue being completed, select **Change blocked by**.
   * To indicate that your issue is no longer preventing another issue from being completed, select **Change blocking**.
4. In the dialog box that opens, deselect the issues that are no longer blocked by, or blocking, your issue.

## Managing issue dependencies with GitHub CLI

GitHub CLI is an open source tool for using GitHub from your computer's command line. When you're working from the command line, you can use the GitHub CLI to save time and avoid switching context. To learn more about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

To create a new issue with dependencies, use the `--blocked-by` and `--blocking` flags on `gh issue create`. Each flag accepts a comma-separated list of issue numbers or URLs.

```shell
gh issue create --title "TITLE" --body "ISSUE-DESCRIPTION" --blocked-by BLOCKED-BY-ISSUE-NUMBER --blocking BLOCKING-ISSUE-NUMBER
```

To add or remove dependencies on an existing issue, use the corresponding flags on `gh issue edit` with the issue number or URL.

```shell
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER --add-blocked-by BLOCKED-BY-ISSUE-NUMBER --add-blocking BLOCKING-ISSUE-NUMBER
gh issue edit ISSUE-NUMBER --remove-blocked-by BLOCKED-BY-ISSUE-NUMBER --remove-blocking BLOCKING-ISSUE-NUMBER
```

To see an issue's dependencies, use `gh issue view`. The output includes "Blocked by" and "Blocking" rows when relationships are set.

```text
My new issue octo-org/octo-repo#123
Open • monalisa opened 3 days ago • 0 comments
Blocked by: octo-org/octo-repo#200 Database schema migration
Blocking: octo-org/octo-repo#300 Release v2.0

  Here are more details.

View this issue on GitHub: https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/123
```

You can also access dependencies programmatically with the `--json` flag using the `blockedBy` and `blocking` fields.

```shell
gh issue view ISSUE-NUMBER --json blockedBy,blocking
```
