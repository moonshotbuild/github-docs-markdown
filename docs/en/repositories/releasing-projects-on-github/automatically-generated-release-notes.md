# Automatically generated release notes

You can automatically generate release notes for your GitHub releases

## About automatically generated release notes

Automatically generated release notes provide an automated alternative to manually writing release notes for your GitHub releases. With automatically generated release notes, you can quickly generate an overview of the contents of a release. Automatically generated release notes include a list of merged pull requests, a list of contributors to the release, and a link to a full changelog.

You can also customize your automated release notes, using labels to create custom categories to organize pull requests you want to include, and exclude certain labels and users from appearing in the output.

## Creating automatically generated release notes for a new release

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. To the right of the list of files, click **Releases**.

   ![Screenshot of the main page of a repository. A link, labeled "Releases", is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/releases/release-link.png)
3. At the top of the page, click **Draft a new release**.
4. To choose a tag for the release, select the **Choose a tag** dropdown menu.
   * To use an existing tag, click the tag.
   * To create a new tag, type a version number for your release, then click **Create new tag**.
5. If you created a new tag, select the **Target** dropdown menu, then click the branch that contains the project you want to release.
6. Optionally, above the description field, select the **Previous tag** dropdown menu, then click the tag that identifies the previous release.

   ![Screenshot of the "New release" form. A dropdown menu, labeled "Previous tag: auto", is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/releases/releases-tag-previous-release.png)
7. In the "Release title" field, type a title for your release.
8. Above the description field, click **Generate release notes**.
9. Check the generated notes to ensure they include all (and only) the information you want to include.
10. Optionally, to include binary files such as compiled programs in your release, drag and drop or manually select files in the binaries box.
11. Optionally, to notify users that the release is not ready for production and may be unstable, select **This is a pre-release**.
12. Optionally, select **Set as latest release**. If you do not select this option, the latest release label will automatically be assigned based on semantic versioning.
13. Optionally, if GitHub Discussions is enabled for the repository, create a discussion for the release.
    * Select **Create a discussion for this release**.
    * Select the **Category** dropdown menu, then click a category for the release discussion.
14. If you're ready to publicize your release, click **Publish release**. To work on the release later, click **Save draft**. If you have enabled immutable releases for the repository, creating a draft first allows you to attach all assets before the release becomes immutable.
    You can then view your published or draft releases in the releases feed for your repository. For more information, see [Viewing your repository's releases and tags](/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags).

## Configuring automatically generated release notes

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, select the **Add file** <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-triangle-down" aria-label="The downwards-facing triangle icon" role="img"><path d="m4.427 7.427 3.396 3.396a.25.25 0 0 0 .354 0l3.396-3.396A.25.25 0 0 0 11.396 7H4.604a.25.25 0 0 0-.177.427Z"></path></svg> dropdown menu, then click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="plus" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg> Create new file**.

   Alternatively, you can click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="The plus sign icon" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg> in the file tree view on the left.

   ![Screenshot of the main page of a repository highlighting both the "Add file" and the "plus sign" icon, described above, with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/add-file-buttons.png)
3. In the file name field, type `.github/release.yml`. This will create a new file called `release.yml` in the `.github` directory.
4. In the file, using the configuration options below, specify in YAML the pull request labels and authors you want to exclude from this release. You can also create new categories and list the pull request labels to be included in each of them.

### Example configurations

A configuration for a repository that labels semver releases

```yaml copy
# .github/release.yml

changelog:
  exclude:
    labels:
      - ignore-for-release
    authors:
      - octocat
  categories:
    - title: Breaking Changes 🛠
      labels:
        - Semver-Major
        - breaking-change
    - title: Exciting New Features 🎉
      labels:
        - Semver-Minor
        - enhancement
    - title: Other Changes
      labels:
        - "*"
```

A configuration for a repository that doesn't tag pull requests but where we want to separate out Dependabot automated pull requests in release notes (`labels: '*'` is required to display a catchall category)

```yaml copy
# .github/release.yml

changelog:
  categories:
    - title: 🏕 Features
      labels:
        - '*'
      exclude:
        labels:
          - dependencies
    - title: 👒 Dependencies
      labels:
        - dependencies
```
