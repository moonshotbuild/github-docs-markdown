# Deleting and restoring branches in a pull request

If you have write access in a repository, you can delete branches that are associated with closed or merged pull requests. You cannot delete branches that are associated with open pull requests.

## Deleting a branch used for a pull request

You can delete a branch that is associated with a pull request if the pull request has been merged or closed and there are no other open pull requests referencing the branch. For information on closing branches that are not associated with pull requests, see [Managing branches within your repository](/en/pull-requests/how-tos/commit-changes/managing-branches-within-your-repository#deleting-a-branch).

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-git-pull-request" aria-label="git-pull-request" role="img"><path d="M1.5 3.25a2.25 2.25 0 1 1 3 2.122v5.256a2.251 2.251 0 1 1-1.5 0V5.372A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 1.5 3.25Zm5.677-.177L9.573.677A.25.25 0 0 1 10 .854V2.5h1A2.5 2.5 0 0 1 13.5 5v5.628a2.251 2.251 0 1 1-1.5 0V5a1 1 0 0 0-1-1h-1v1.646a.25.25 0 0 1-.427.177L7.177 3.427a.25.25 0 0 1 0-.354ZM3.75 2.5a.75.75 0 1 0 0 1.5.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5Zm0 9.5a.75.75 0 1 0 0 1.5.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5Zm8.25.75a.75.75 0 1 0 1.5 0 .75.75 0 0 0-1.5 0Z"></path></svg> Pull requests**.
3. To see a list of closed pull requests, click **Closed**.

4. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request that's associated with the branch that you want to delete.
5. Near the bottom of the pull request, click **Delete branch**.
