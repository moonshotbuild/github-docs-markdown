# Managing remote repositories

Learn to work with your local repositories on your computer and remote repositories hosted on GitHub.

## Adding a remote repository

To add a new remote, use the `git remote add` command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.

The `git remote add` command takes two arguments:

* A remote name, for example, `origin`
* A remote URL, for example, `https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git`

For example:

```shell
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
# Set a new remote

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

For more information on which URL to use, see [About remote repositories](/en/get-started/git-basics/about-remote-repositories).

### Troubleshooting: Remote origin already exists

This error means you've tried to add a remote with a name that already exists in your local repository.

```shell
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
> fatal: remote origin already exists.
```

To fix this, you can:

* Use a different name for the new remote.
* Rename the existing remote repository before you add the new remote. For more information, see [Renaming a remote repository](#renaming-a-remote-repository) below.
* Delete the existing remote repository before you add the new remote. For more information, see [Removing a remote repository](#removing-a-remote-repository) below.

## Changing a remote repository's URL

The `git remote set-url` command changes an existing remote repository URL.

> \[!TIP]
> For information on the difference between HTTPS and SSH URLs, see [About remote repositories](/en/get-started/git-basics/about-remote-repositories).

The `git remote set-url` command takes two arguments:

* An existing remote name. For example, `origin` or `upstream` are two common choices.
* A new URL for the remote. For example:

  * If you're updating to use HTTPS, your URL might look like:

  ```shell
  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
  ```

  * If you're updating to use SSH, your URL might look like:

  ```shell
  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
  ```

### Switching remote URLs from SSH to HTTPS

1. Open <span class="platform-mac">Terminal</span><span class="platform-linux">Terminal</span><span class="platform-windows">Git Bash</span>.

2. Change the current working directory to your local project.

3. List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

   ```shell
   $ git remote -v
   > origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
   > origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
   ```

4. Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the `git remote set-url` command.

   ```shell
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
   ```

5. Verify that the remote URL has changed.

   ```shell
   $ git remote -v
   # Verify new remote URL
   > origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
   > origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
   ```

The next time you `git fetch`, `git pull`, or `git push` to the remote repository, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md). Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. For more information, see [Managing your personal access tokens](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

You can [use a credential helper](/en/get-started/git-basics/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git) so Git will remember your GitHub username and personal access token every time it talks to GitHub.

### Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH

1. Open <span class="platform-mac">Terminal</span><span class="platform-linux">Terminal</span><span class="platform-windows">Git Bash</span>.

2. Change the current working directory to your local project.

3. List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

   ```shell
   $ git remote -v
   > origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
   > origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
   ```

4. Change your remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH with the `git remote set-url` command.

   ```shell
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
   ```

5. Verify that the remote URL has changed.

   ```shell
   $ git remote -v
   # Verify new remote URL
   > origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
   > origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
   ```

### Troubleshooting: No such remote '\[name]'

This error means that the remote you tried to change doesn't exist:

```shell
$ git remote set-url sofake https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
> fatal: No such remote 'sofake'
```

Check that you've correctly typed the remote name.

## Renaming a remote repository

Use the `git remote rename` command to rename an existing remote.

The `git remote rename` command takes two arguments:

* An existing remote name, for example, `origin`
* A new name for the remote, for example, `destination`

### Example of renaming a remote repository

These examples assume you're [cloning using HTTPS](/en/get-started/git-basics/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls), which is recommended.

```shell
$ git remote -v
# View existing remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

$ git remote rename origin destination
# Change remote name from 'origin' to 'destination'

$ git remote -v
# Verify remote's new name
> destination  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> destination  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

### Troubleshooting: Could not rename config section 'remote.\[old name]' to 'remote.\[new name]'

This error means that the old remote name you typed doesn't exist.

You can check which remotes currently exist with the `git remote -v` command:

```shell
$ git remote -v
# View existing remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

### Troubleshooting: Remote \[new name] already exists

This error means that the remote name you want to use already exists. To solve this, either use a different remote name, or rename the original remote.

## Removing a remote repository

Use the `git remote rm` command to remove a remote URL from your repository.

The `git remote rm` command takes one argument:

* A remote name, for example, `destination`

Removing the remote URL from your repository only unlinks the local and remote repositories. It does not delete the remote repository.

### Example of removing a remote repository

These examples assume you're [cloning using HTTPS](/en/get-started/git-basics/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls), which is recommended.

```shell
$ git remote -v
# View current remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

$ git remote rm destination
# Remove remote
$ git remote -v
# Verify it's gone
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

> \[!NOTE]
> `git remote rm` does not delete the remote repository from the server. It simply removes the remote and its references from your local repository.

### Troubleshooting: Could not remove config section 'remote.\[name]'

This error means that the remote you tried to delete doesn't exist:

```shell
$ git remote rm sofake
> error: Could not remove config section 'remote.sofake'
```

Check that you've correctly typed the remote name.
