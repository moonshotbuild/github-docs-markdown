# Attaching files

You can convey information by attaching a variety of file types to your issues and pull requests.

> \[!NOTE]
> For public repositories, uploaded files can be accessed without authentication. In the case of private and internal repositories, only people with access to the repository can view the uploaded files.

To attach a file to an issue or pull request conversation, drag and drop it into the comment box.
Alternatively, you can click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-paperclip" aria-label="Attach files" role="img"><path d="M12.212 3.02a1.753 1.753 0 0 0-2.478.003l-5.83 5.83a3.007 3.007 0 0 0-.88 2.127c0 .795.315 1.551.88 2.116.567.567 1.333.89 2.126.89.79 0 1.548-.321 2.116-.89l5.48-5.48a.75.75 0 0 1 1.061 1.06l-5.48 5.48a4.492 4.492 0 0 1-3.177 1.33c-1.2 0-2.345-.487-3.187-1.33a4.483 4.483 0 0 1-1.32-3.177c0-1.195.475-2.341 1.32-3.186l5.83-5.83a3.25 3.25 0 0 1 5.553 2.297c0 .863-.343 1.691-.953 2.301L7.439 12.39c-.375.377-.884.59-1.416.593a1.998 1.998 0 0 1-1.412-.593 1.992 1.992 0 0 1 0-2.828l5.48-5.48a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-5.48 5.48a.492.492 0 0 0 0 .707.499.499 0 0 0 .352.154.51.51 0 0 0 .356-.154l5.833-5.827a1.755 1.755 0 0 0 0-2.481Z"></path></svg> below the issue comment box to browse, select, and add a file from your computer.

When you attach a file, it is uploaded immediately to GitHub and the text field is updated to show the anonymized URL for the file. For more information on anonymized URLs see [About anonymized URLs](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-anonymized-urls).
