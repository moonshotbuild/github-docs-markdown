# Creating a permanent link to a code snippet

You can create a permanent link to a specific line or range of lines of code in a specific version of a file or pull request.

## Linking to code

This type of permanent link will render as a code snippet only in the repository it originated in. In other repositories, the permalink code snippet will render as a URL. This does not work in Markdown files, only in comments.

> \[!TIP]
> To create a permalink for an entire file, see [Getting permanent links to files](/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/getting-permanent-links-to-files).

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Locate the code you'd like to link to:
   * To link to code from a file, navigate to the file.
   * To link to code from a pull request, navigate to the pull request and click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-diff" aria-label="diff" role="img"><path d="M8.75 1.75V5H12a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.75v3.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V6.5H4A.75.75 0 0 1 4 5h3.25V1.75a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM4 13h8a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H4A.75.75 0 0 1 4 13Z"></path></svg> Files changed**. Then, browse to the file that contains the code you want to include in your comment, and click **View**.
3. Choose whether to select a single line or a range.

   * To select a single line of code, click the line number to highlight the line.
   * To select a range of code, click the number of the first line in the range to highlight the line of code. Then, hover over the last line of the code range, press <kbd>Shift</kbd>, and click the line number to highlight the range.
4. To the left of the line or range of lines, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Code line X options" role="img"><path d="M8 9a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3ZM1.5 9a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Zm13 0a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3Z"></path></svg>. In the drop-down menu, click **Copy permalink**.

   ![Screenshot of a file, with 8 lines selected. To the left of the first selected line, a button labeled with a kebab icon is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/repository/open-new-issue-specific-line.png)
5. Navigate to the conversation where you want to link to the code snippet.
6. Paste your permalink into a comment, and click **Comment**.

## Linking to Markdown

You can link to specific lines in Markdown files by loading the Markdown file without Markdown rendering. To load a Markdown file without rendering, you can use the `?plain=1` parameter at the end of the URL for the file. For example, `github.com/<organization>/<repository>/blob/<commit_SHA>/README.md?plain=1`.

You can link to a specific line in the Markdown file the same way you can in code. Append `#L` with the line number or numbers at the end of the URL. For example, `github.com/<organization>/<repository>/blob/<commit_SHA>/README.md?plain=1#L14` will highlight line 14 in the plain README.md file.
