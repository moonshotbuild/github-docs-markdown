# Reverting a pull request

Create a new pull request to revert a previously merged pull request and address merge conflicts if they arise.

## About reverting a pull request

Reverting a merged pull request creates a new pull request that reverts the original merge commit. You must have [write permissions](/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization) in the repository.

## Reverting a pull request

> \[!NOTE]
> You may need to revert individual commits if reverting the pull request causes merge conflicts or if the original pull request was not merged on GitHub. See [Git revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert.html) in the Git documentation.

2. In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request you want to revert.

3. Near the bottom of the pull request, click **Revert**. If the **Revert** option isn't displayed, you need to ask the repository administrator for write permissions.
