# Troubleshooting required status checks

Resolve common errors and unblock merging or pushing to protected branches by troubleshooting required status checks.

Use these checks when a required status check blocks merging or pushing to a protected branch. See [Status checks](/en/pull-requests/reference/status-checks).

* A required status check must have completed successfully in the chosen repository during the past seven days.
* If a check and a commit status have the same name, both must pass when that name is required. See [REST API endpoints for checks](/en/rest/checks).
* If branch protection requires your branch to be up-to-date, merge or rebase the base branch into your branch. See [About protected branches](/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging) and [About Git rebase](/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-rebase).

If required status checks have not passed, pushing to a protected branch returns an error similar to this.

```shell
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/main.
remote: error: Required status check "ci-build" is failing
```

> \[!NOTE]
> Pull requests that are up-to-date and pass required status checks can be merged locally and pushed to the protected branch. You can do this without running status checks on the merge commit itself.

## Required check needs to succeed against the latest commit SHA

Check the following if a required check is still blocking a pull request.

* Required checks must pass on the latest commit SHA. Checks from earlier commits don't satisfy the requirement.
* Successful check statuses are `success`, `skipped`, and `neutral`. See [Status checks](/en/pull-requests/reference/status-checks).

## Conflicts between head commit and test merge commit

Use the pull request status checks box to identify which commit must pass.

| Status check source             | What must pass        | What you may see                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Test merge commit has a status  | The test merge commit | `Showing checks for the merge commit` |
| Test merge commit has no status | The head commit       | Checks for the latest head commit     |

See [REST API endpoints for pull requests](/en/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request).

### Example

This workflow requires a successful `build` job, but runs only when a pull request changes files in `scripts`.

```yaml
name: ci
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'scripts/**'
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 16.x]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v6
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v7
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test
```

A pull request that only changes a file in the repository root will not trigger this workflow. If `build` is required, the pull request is blocked with "Waiting for status to be reported."

### Status checks with GitHub Actions and a Merge queue

If a merge queue requires a GitHub Actions check, trigger the workflow with the `merge_group` event.

> \[!NOTE]
> If your repository uses GitHub Actions to perform required checks on pull requests in your repository, you need to update the workflows to include the `merge_group` event as an additional trigger. Otherwise, status checks will not be triggered when you add a pull request to a merge queue. The merge will fail as the required status check will not be reported. The `merge_group` event is separate from the `pull_request` and `push` events.

Example trigger configuration:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
  merge_group:
```

See [Events that trigger workflows](/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#merge_group).

## Required status checks from unexpected sources

A protected branch can also require a status check from a specific GitHub App. If you see a message similar to the following, verify that the check listed in the merge box was set by the expected app.

```text
Required status check "build" was not set by the expected GitHub App.
```
