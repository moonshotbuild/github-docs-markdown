# Automatically merging a pull request

Enable or disable auto-merge for pull requests to streamline your workflow and automatically merge changes once all requirements are met.

## About auto-merge

Auto-merge merges a pull request automatically after all required reviews and status checks pass. Before you use auto-merge, it must be enabled for the repository. See [Managing auto-merge for pull requests in your repository](/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository).

Auto-merge is disabled if someone without write permissions pushes new changes to the head branch or switches the base branch.

## Enabling auto-merge

> \[!NOTE]
> The option to enable auto-merge is shown only on pull requests that cannot be merged immediately. For example, when a branch protection rule enforces "Require pull request reviews before merging" or "Require status checks to pass before merging" and these conditions are not yet met. For more information, see [Managing a branch protection rule](/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).

People with write permissions to a repository can enable auto-merge for a pull request.
