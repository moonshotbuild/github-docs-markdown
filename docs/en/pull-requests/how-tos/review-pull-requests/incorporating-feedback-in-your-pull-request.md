# Incorporating feedback in your pull request

Apply suggested changes directly to a pull request, batch multiple suggestions into a single commit, or open an issue to track out-of-scope feedback.

## Applying suggested changes

Other people can suggest specific changes to your pull request. You can apply these suggested changes directly in a pull request if you have write access to the repository.

If the pull request was created from a fork and the author allowed edits from maintainers, you can also apply suggested changes if you have write access to the upstream repository. See [Commenting on a pull request](/en/pull-requests/how-tos/review-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) and [Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork](/en/pull-requests/how-tos/work-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

To quickly incorporate more than one suggested change into a single commit, you can also apply suggested changes as a batch. Applying one suggested change or a batch of suggested changes creates a single commit on the compare branch of the pull request.

Each person who suggested a change included in the commit will be a co-author of the commit. The person who applies the suggested changes will be a co-author and the committer of the commit. See [Git Basics - Viewing the Commit History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History) from the *Pro Git* book site.

To request a fresh review from a reviewer, in the sidebar of the **Conversation** tab, click the <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-sync" aria-label="The sync icon" role="img"><path d="M1.705 8.005a.75.75 0 0 1 .834.656 5.5 5.5 0 0 0 9.592 2.97l-1.204-1.204a.25.25 0 0 1 .177-.427h3.646a.25.25 0 0 1 .25.25v3.646a.25.25 0 0 1-.427.177l-1.38-1.38A7.002 7.002 0 0 1 1.05 8.84a.75.75 0 0 1 .656-.834ZM8 2.5a5.487 5.487 0 0 0-4.131 1.869l1.204 1.204A.25.25 0 0 1 4.896 6H1.25A.25.25 0 0 1 1 5.75V2.104a.25.25 0 0 1 .427-.177l1.38 1.38A7.002 7.002 0 0 1 14.95 7.16a.75.75 0 0 1-1.49.178A5.5 5.5 0 0 0 8 2.5Z"></path></svg> icon.

## Opening an issue for an out-of-scope suggestion

If someone suggests changes to your pull request and the changes are out of the pull request's scope, you can open a new issue to track the feedback. See [Creating an issue](/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue).
