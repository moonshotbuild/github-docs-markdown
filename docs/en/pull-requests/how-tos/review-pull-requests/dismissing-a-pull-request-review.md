# Dismissing a pull request review

Dismiss outdated or unapproved pull request reviews and update their status with a required comment.

If a pull request has changed since it was reviewed and the person who requested changes isn't available to give an approving review, repository administrators or people with write access can dismiss a review.
Dismissing a review changes the status of the review to a review comment. When you dismiss a review, you must add a comment explaining why you dismissed it. Your comment will be added to the pull request conversation.

You can find a pull request where you or a team you're a member of is requested for review with the search qualifier `review-requested:[USERNAME]` or `team-review-requested:[TEAMNAME]`. For more information, see [Searching issues and pull requests](/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests).
