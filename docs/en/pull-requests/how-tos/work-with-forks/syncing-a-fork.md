# Syncing a fork

Sync a forked repository with its upstream repository using the web interface, GitHub CLI, or command line.

## Syncing a fork branch from the web UI

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the forked repository that you want to sync with the upstream repository.
2. Above the list of files, select the **Sync fork** dropdown menu.

   ![Screenshot of the main page of a fork. A dropdown menu, labeled with a sync icon and "Sync fork," is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/repository/sync-fork-dropdown.png)
3. Review the details about the commits from the upstream repository, then click **Update branch**.

If the changes from the upstream repository cause conflicts, GitHub will prompt you to create a pull request to resolve the conflicts.

## Syncing a fork branch with the GitHub CLI

GitHub CLI is an open source tool for using GitHub from your computer's command line. When you're working from the command line, you can use the GitHub CLI to save time and avoid switching context. To learn more about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

To update the remote fork from its parent, use the `gh repo sync -b BRANCH-NAME` subcommand and supply your fork and branch name as arguments.

```shell
gh repo sync owner/cli-fork -b BRANCH-NAME
```

If the changes from the upstream repository cause conflicts, the GitHub CLI can't sync. To overwrite the destination branch, use the `--force` flag.

## Syncing a fork branch from the command line

Before you can sync your fork with an upstream repository, you must configure a remote that points to the upstream repository in Git. See [Configuring a remote repository for a fork](/en/pull-requests/how-tos/work-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork).

1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.

2. Change the current working directory to your local project.

3. Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to `BRANCH-NAME` will be stored in the local branch `upstream/BRANCH-NAME`.

   ```shell
   $ git fetch upstream
   > remote: Counting objects: 75, done.
   > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
   > remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9)
   > Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.
   > From https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY
   >  * [new branch]      main     -> upstream/main
   ```

4. Check out your fork's local default branch. In this example, we use `main`.

   ```shell
   $ git checkout main
   > Switched to branch 'main'
   ```

5. Merge the changes from the upstream default branch into your local default branch. In this example, the upstream default branch is `upstream/main`. This syncs your fork's default branch with the upstream repository without losing your local changes.

   ```shell
   $ git merge upstream/main
   > Updating a422352..5fdff0f
   > Fast-forward
   >  README                    |    9 -------
   >  README.md                 |    7 ++++++
   >  2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)
   >  delete mode 100644 README
   >  create mode 100644 README.md
   ```

   If your local branch didn't have any unique commits, Git will perform a fast-forward. See [Basic Branching and Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) in the Git documentation.

   ```shell
   $ git merge upstream/main
   > Updating 34e91da..16c56ad
   > Fast-forward
   >  README.md                 |    5 +++--
   >  1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
   ```

   If your local branch had unique commits, you may need to resolve conflicts. See [Merge and close pull requests](/en/pull-requests/how-tos/merge-and-close-pull-requests).

> \[!TIP]
> Syncing your fork only updates your local copy of the repository. To update your fork on GitHub.com, you must [push your changes](/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository).
