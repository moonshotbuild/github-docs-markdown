# Keeping your pull request in sync with the base branch

Update your pull request branch with changes from the base branch to resolve conflicts and ensure compatibility before merging.

## About keeping your pull request in sync

Before merging, update your pull request branch with changes from the base branch to catch conflicts or test failures early. You can update the branch from the pull request page when there are no merge conflicts and the branch is behind the base branch.

> \[!NOTE]
> You may not be able to use the `Update branch` button if the HEAD branch of your pull request is a protected branch. See [About protected branches](/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches).

If changes to the base branch cause merge conflicts in your pull request branch, resolve the conflicts before updating the branch. See [Merge conflicts](/en/pull-requests/reference/merge-conflicts).

From the pull request page, you can update by merging the base branch into your head branch or by rebasing your changes onto the latest base branch. Rebasing creates a linear history without a merge commit. See [Branches](/en/pull-requests/reference/branches#three-dot-and-two-dot-git-diff-comparisons).
