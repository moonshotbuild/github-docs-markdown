# Changing the base branch of a pull request

Modify the base branch of an open pull request to compare changes against a different branch and ensure accurate updates.

> \[!WARNING]
> When you change the base branch of your pull request, some commits may be removed from the timeline. Review comments may also become outdated because the line of code that the comment referenced may no longer be part of the changes in the pull request.

1. Under your repository name, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-git-pull-request" aria-label="git-pull-request" role="img"><path d="M1.5 3.25a2.25 2.25 0 1 1 3 2.122v5.256a2.251 2.251 0 1 1-1.5 0V5.372A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 1.5 3.25Zm5.677-.177L9.573.677A.25.25 0 0 1 10 .854V2.5h1A2.5 2.5 0 0 1 13.5 5v5.628a2.251 2.251 0 1 1-1.5 0V5a1 1 0 0 0-1-1h-1v1.646a.25.25 0 0 1-.427.177L7.177 3.427a.25.25 0 0 1 0-.354ZM3.75 2.5a.75.75 0 1 0 0 1.5.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5Zm0 9.5a.75.75 0 1 0 0 1.5.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5Zm8.25.75a.75.75 0 1 0 1.5 0 .75.75 0 0 0-1.5 0Z"></path></svg> Pull requests**.

5. Read the information about changing the base branch and click **Change base**.

> \[!TIP]
> When you open a pull request, GitHub sets the base to the commit that branch references. If the branch is updated in the future, GitHub does not update the base branch's commit.
