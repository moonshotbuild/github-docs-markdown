# Quickstart for reviewing pull requests

Review a pull request by leaving comments, making suggestions, and approving or requesting changes.

Pull request reviews are how teams catch issues early and keep code quality high. This quickstart walks you through each of the main tools for a review:

* Comment on code
* Suggest specific edits
* Submit your review and approve or request changes

## Comment on the changes

Anyone with read access to a repository can review and comment on a pull request.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the pull request.
2. Read through the pull request summary and any relevant comments or issues to build context for reviewing.
3. Click the **Files changed** tab.
4. Hover over the line you want to comment on and click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="Add a comment" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg>. To comment on multiple lines, click and drag to select them.
5. Type your comment, then click **Start a review** to save it as pending until you finish reviewing. Pending comments are visible only to you until you submit the review.

## Make code suggestions

When you know the exact change you'd like, suggest it so the author can apply it in one click.

1. On the **Files changed** tab, start a comment on the line or lines you want to change.
2. In the comment toolbar, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-diff" aria-label="Insert a suggestion" role="img"><path d="M8.75 1.75V5H12a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.75v3.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V6.5H4A.75.75 0 0 1 4 5h3.25V1.75a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM4 13h8a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H4A.75.75 0 0 1 4 13Z"></path></svg> to insert a suggestion block, then edit the code inside it to show your proposed change.
3. Click **Start a review** or **Add review comment** to include the suggestion in your review.

## Submit your review

Finish by submitting your review with a decision that tells the author what to do next.

1. Click **Review changes**.
2. Add a summary comment.
3. Select a decision, then click **Submit review**:

   * **Comment** leaves feedback without explicitly approving or requesting changes.
   * **Approve** signals that the changes are ready to merge.
   * **Request changes** flags feedback the author must address before merging.
