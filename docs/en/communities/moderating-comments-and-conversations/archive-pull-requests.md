# Archive pull requests

Repository administrators can archive a pull request to remove it from public view, providing a moderation option between leaving a pull request up and permanently deleting it.

## About archiving pull requests

Archiving a pull request removes it from public view while preserving its history for repository administrators. This provides a safer moderation path when they need to take a pull request out of public view without permanently deleting it.

When a pull request is archived:

* The pull request is only visible to repository administrators. Visitors without administrator access to the repository receive a 404 error.
* The pull request is automatically closed and locked.

When you unarchive a pull request, it becomes visible again, but it remains closed and locked. You can reopen and unlock it separately if needed.

## Archiving a pull request

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click **<svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-git-pull-request" aria-label="git-pull-request" role="img"><path d="M1.5 3.25a2.25 2.25 0 1 1 3 2.122v5.256a2.251 2.251 0 1 1-1.5 0V5.372A2.25 2.25 0 0 1 1.5 3.25Zm5.677-.177L9.573.677A.25.25 0 0 1 10 .854V2.5h1A2.5 2.5 0 0 1 13.5 5v5.628a2.251 2.251 0 1 1-1.5 0V5a1 1 0 0 0-1-1h-1v1.646a.25.25 0 0 1-.427.177L7.177 3.427a.25.25 0 0 1 0-.354ZM3.75 2.5a.75.75 0 1 0 0 1.5.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5Zm0 9.5a.75.75 0 1 0 0 1.5.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5Zm8.25.75a.75.75 0 1 0 1.5 0 .75.75 0 0 0-1.5 0Z"></path></svg> Pull requests**.
