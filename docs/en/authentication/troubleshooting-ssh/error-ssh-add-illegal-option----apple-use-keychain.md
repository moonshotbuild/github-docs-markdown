# Error: ssh-add: illegal option -- apple-use-keychain

This error means your version of ssh-add does not support macOS keychain integration, which allows you to store your passphrase in the keychain.

The `--apple-use-keychain` option is in Apple's standard version of `ssh-add`, which stores the passphrase in your keychain for you when you add an ssh key to the ssh-agent. If you have installed a different version of `ssh-add`, it may lack support for `--apple-use-keychain`.

## Solving the issue

To add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent, you can specify the path to the Apple version of `ssh-add`:

```shell
/usr/bin/ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

> \[!NOTE]
>
> * The `--apple-use-keychain` option is in Apple's standard version of `ssh-add`. In macOS versions prior to Monterey (12.0), use `-K` instead of `--apple-use-keychain`.
> * If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace *id\_ed25519* in the command with the name of your private key file.
