# Using GitHub in Slack

Learn how to use GitHub in Slack to improve collaboration and streamline your workflow.

The GitHub integration for Slack allows you to connect your GitHub account to the GitHub app in Slack. Once connected, you can use slash commands to interact with GitHub, receive notifications about repository activity, and collaborate with your team directly within Slack.

## Connecting your GitHub account to the GitHub app in Slack

> \[!NOTE] Before you can connect your accounts, an admin for your Slack workspace must have installed the GitHub app. See [Integrating GitHub with Slack](/en/integrations/how-tos/slack/integrate-github-with-slack).

1. In Slack, start a direct message with the GitHub app.
2. The direct message will be pre-populated with a welcome message and a link to connect your GitHub account. Follow the prompts on screen in Slack, and in GitHub in your browser, to authenticate and authorize the connection.

Once your GitHub account is connected, Slack will show you a list of available commands and features you can use.

## Using Slash commands to interact with GitHub in Slack

To use a slash command, type `/github` followed by the command you want to execute in the message input field of any Slack channel or direct message where the GitHub app is present. To invite the app to a channel, type `/invite @github` in the channel.

| Command                                           | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/github help`                                    | Displays a list of essential commands and their descriptions.                                                      |
| `/github subscribe owner/repo`                    | Subscribes the channel to notifications for the specified repository.                                              |
| `/github unsubscribe owner/repo`                  | Unsubscribes the channel from notifications for the specified repository.                                          |
| `/github subscribe list`                          | Lists all repositories the channel is subscribed to.                                                               |
| `/github open owner/repo`                         | Opens an issue in the specified repository. You will be prompted to provide a title and description for the issue. |
| `/github close [issue link]`                      | Closes the specified issue as completed.                                                                           |
| `/github close [issue link] reason:"not planned"` | Closes the specified issue with a reason. Replace `"not planned"` with your reason.                                |
| `/github reopen [issue link]`                     | Reopens the specified issue.                                                                                       |
| `/github signin`                                  | Restarts the "Connect your GitHub account" workflow.                                                               |
| `/github signout`                                 | Disconnects your GitHub account from your Slack user.                                                              |

> \[!NOTE] When you subscribe a channel to a repository, the channel will receive notifications for all `open`, `close`, and `reopen` events on pull requests and issues in that repository. The channel will also receive notifications of any `push` events directly to the repository's default branch.

## Initiating Copilot cloud agent sessions within Slack

The GitHub app also integrates Copilot cloud agent into Slack. You can use this functionality to summon Copilot cloud agent in threads where important discussions are taking place, and ask it to make changes based on the context of those discussions. See: [Integrating Copilot cloud agent with Slack](/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/cloud-agent/integrate-cloud-agent-with-slack).

## Mentions in Slack

When you subscribe to a repository in Slack, you will see yourself mentioned in notifications for repository events in which you have been referenced. For example, if you are assigned to an issue, or mentioned in a comment, you will see yourself mentioned in the notification in Slack.

Mentions require you to be logged in to your GitHub account through the GitHub app in Slack. This enables GitHub to map your Slack identity to your GitHub identity. See [Connecting your GitHub account to the GitHub app in Slack](#connecting-your-github-account-to-the-github-app-in-slack).

> \[!NOTE]
> If you have multiple Slack workspaces where you use the GitHub app, mentions will only work in the workspace where you logged in to your GitHub app most recently. If you log in to your GitHub app in a different workspace, mentions will stop working in the previous workspace.

The following are scenarios in which you will be mentioned:

* You are assigned to an issue.
* Your review is requested on a pull request.
* You are mentioned in a pull request, issue description, comment, or discussion.
* Your review is requested on a deployment.
* You receive a scheduled reminder for a pull review request.

You can see a summary of your GitHub mentions in the "Mentions" view in Slack. For more information, see [Triage notifications in the Activity tab](https://slack.com/help/articles/19693583638803-Triage-notifications-in-the-Activity-tab) in the Slack documentation.

## Threading conversations

Notifications for each issue or pull request are grouped into a thread in Slack. The parent message always shows the latest status of the issue or pull request, along with other meta-data like title, description, assignees, reviewers, labels and checks. Threading helps keep conversations organized, making it easier to follow updates and discussions related to a specific issue or pull request. When the state of an issue or pull request changes, the associated reply is posted both in the thread and in the channel, so that everyone in the channel is aware of the update.

You can disable threading for issue and pull request notifications in individual channels.

1. In the Slack channel where you want to disable threading, type `/github settings`.
2. In the settings menu, to the right of "Disable threading for Pull Request and Issue notifications", click **Disable**.

You, or any other member of the channel, can re-enable threading at any time by following the same steps and clicking **Enable** in the settings menu.

## Broadcasting comments and reviews to the Slack channel

By default, comments and reviews will only show up in their related thread. If you want the channel members to see them instead of just those who are participants of the issue, you can opt-in to broadcasting with the following commands:

* For comment broadcasting, use `/github subscribe owner/repo comments:"channel"`

* For review broadcasting, use `/github subscribe owner/repo reviews:"channel"`

## Unfurling links to GitHub activities in Slack

Link previews provide additional context when sharing links to GitHub activities in Slack. Link previews are shown in Slack for the following GitHub activities:

* Pull requests
* Issues
* Directly linked comments
* Code blobs with line numbers
* Organizations, repositories, and users

Previews of links will not be shown if any of the following apply:

* Link previews are disabled in your Slack workspace. See [Share links and set preview preferences](https://slack.com/help/articles/204399343-Share-links-and-set-preview-preferences#turn-off-link-previews-for-specific-sites) in the Slack documentation.
* The same link has already been shared in the channel in the past 30 minutes.
* 3 or more links are shared in the same message.
* The repository is private, and the user who shared the link:
  * Has not connected their GitHub account to the GitHub app in Slack.
  * Asked not to show link previews when prompted.
  * The GitHub app is not in the channel where the link is shared. See [Using slash commands to interact with GitHub in Slack](#using-slash-commands-to-interact-with-github-in-slack).

## Scheduling reminders for pull request reviews

You can schedule reminders for pull request reviews in Slack. Reminders can be sent to you directly in a direct message with the GitHub app, or to a channel where the GitHub app is present. For example, you can schedule a reminder to be sent to you in a direct message every weekday at 10 AM including all open issues that are assigned to you.

You can configure scheduled reminders for yourself, your team, or your entire organization. For more information, see:

* [Managing your scheduled reminders](/en/subscriptions-and-notifications/how-tos/managing-your-scheduled-reminders)
* [Managing scheduled reminders for your team](/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-team)
