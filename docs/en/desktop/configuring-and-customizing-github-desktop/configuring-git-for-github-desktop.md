# Configuring Git for GitHub Desktop

You can manage Git configuration settings for your local repositories with GitHub Desktop.

## About Git configuration for GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop uses your local Git configuration settings and provides the option to configure some of these settings, such as the global author information and the default branch that is used when creating a new repository.

GitHub Desktop allows you to set the name and email address you would like associated with the commits you make in your repositories. If your name and email address have already been set in the global Git configuration for your computer, GitHub Desktop will detect and use those values. GitHub Desktop also allows you to set a different name and email address for an individual repository. This is useful when you need to use a separate work email address for a specific repository.

If the email address that has been set in your Git configuration does not match an email address associated with the GitHub account you are currently logged in to, GitHub Desktop will show a warning prior to committing.

GitHub Desktop also allows you to change the default branch name that you would like to use when creating new repositories. By default, GitHub Desktop uses `main` as the default branch name in any new repositories you create.

> \[!TIP]
> Anyone will be able to see the email address in your Git configuration if you make public commits. For more information, see [Setting your commit email address](/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).

## Configuring your global author information

Configuring your global author information in GitHub Desktop will update the name and email address in your global Git configuration. This will be the default name and email address for all new local repositories you create in GitHub Desktop.

## Configuring your shell environment for Git hooks

GitHub Desktop runs Git hooks in your configured shell environment. This means hooks have access to the same environment variables, shell configuration files (such as `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`), and tools as when you run Git from the command line. Tools installed via version managers, such as `nvm` or `rbenv`, will also be available to your hooks.

You can configure hook environment settings in the **Hooks** tab of the **Git** settings pane.

<div class="ghd-tool mac">

1. In the menu bar, select **GitHub Desktop**, then click **Settings**.

   ![Screenshot of the menu bar on a Mac. Under the open "GitHub Desktop" dropdown menu, the cursor hovers over "Settings", which is highlighted in blue.](/assets/images/help/desktop/mac-choose-settings.png)
2. In the "Settings" window, click **Git**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Git" pane in the "Settings" window. In the left sidebar, an option labeled "Git" is highlighted in blue and outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/desktop/mac-select-git-pane.png)
3. Click the **Hooks** tab.

</div>

<div class="ghd-tool windows">

1. Click the **Hooks** tab.

</div>

The following settings are available:

* **Load Git hook environment variables from shell**: When enabled, GitHub Desktop loads environment variables from your shell when executing Git hooks. Enable this if your hooks depend on tools installed via version managers such as `nvm`, `rbenv`, or `asdf`.

<div class="ghd-tool mac">

* **Cache Git hook environment variables**: Caches hook environment variables to improve performance. Disable this if your hooks rely on frequently changing environment variables.

</div>
