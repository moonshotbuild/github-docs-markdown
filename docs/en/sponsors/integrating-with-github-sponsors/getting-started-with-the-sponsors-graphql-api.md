# Getting started with the Sponsors GraphQL API

Using the GraphQL API, you can build custom integrations to manage or review your sponsorships.

To get started with the GraphQL API, see [Introduction to GraphQL](/en/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql).

You can find the details about the Sponsors GraphQL API in the reference docs. For more information, see [Reference](/en/graphql/reference). We recommend using the GraphQL clients to build your GraphQL calls. For more information, see [Using GraphQL Clients](/en/graphql/guides/using-graphql-clients).

## Known Issues
