# Using VS Code for the Web from GitHub

You can open a repository or pull request in VS Code for the Web directly from GitHub to browse code, edit files, and commit your changes.

> \[!NOTE] Opening a repository at `github.dev` opens it in VS Code for the Web, the browser-based version of VS Code. For more information, see [VS Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-web) in the VS Code documentation.

## About VS Code for the Web

VS Code for the Web is a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. With VS Code for the Web, you can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes. You can open any repository, fork, or pull request in the editor.

VS Code for the Web is available to everyone for free on GitHub.com.

VS Code for the Web provides many of the benefits of Visual Studio Code, such as search, syntax highlighting, and a source control view. You can also use Settings Sync to share your own VS Code settings with the editor. See [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) in the VS Code documentation.

VS Code for the Web runs entirely in your browser’s sandbox. The editor doesn’t clone the repository, but instead uses the [GitHub Repositories extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension) to carry out most of the functionality that you will use. Your work is saved in the browser’s local storage until you commit it. You should commit your changes regularly to ensure that they're always accessible.

You must be signed in to GitHub to use VS Code for the Web.

## Opening VS Code for the Web from GitHub

You can open any GitHub repository in VS Code for the Web in any of the following ways:

* To open the repository in the same browser tab, press <kbd>.</kbd> while browsing any repository or pull request on GitHub.

  To open the repository in a new browser tab, press <kbd>></kbd>.

* Change the URL from "github.com" to "github.dev".

* When viewing a file, select the <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-triangle-down" aria-label="More edit options" role="img"><path d="m4.427 7.427 3.396 3.396a.25.25 0 0 0 .354 0l3.396-3.396A.25.25 0 0 0 11.396 7H4.604a.25.25 0 0 0-.177.427Z"></path></svg> dropdown menu and click **github.dev**.

## Codespaces and VS Code for the Web

Both VS Code for the Web and GitHub Codespaces allow you to edit your code straight from your repository. However, both have slightly different benefits, depending on your use case.

## Using source control

When you use VS Code for the Web, all actions are managed through the "Source Control" view, which is located in the Activity Bar on the left hand side. For more information on the "Source Control" view, see [Version Control](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) in the VS Code documentation.

Because VS Code for the Web uses the GitHub Repositories extension to power its functionality, you can switch branches without needing to stash changes. See [GitHub Repositories](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension) in the VS Code documentation.

### Create a new branch

1. If the current branch is not shown in the status bar, at the bottom of your codespace, right-click the status bar and select **Source control**.

2. Click the branch name in the status bar.

   ![Screenshot of the branch name displayed in the status bar of VS Code.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/branch-in-status-bar.png)

3. In the dropdown, either click the branch you want to switch to, or enter the name for a new branch and click **Create new branch**.

   ![Screenshot of the dropdown for creating a new branch in VS Code.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/create-new-branch.png)
   Any uncommitted changes you have made in your old branch will be available on your new branch.

### Commit your changes

1. In the Activity Bar, click the **Source Control** view.

   ![Screenshot of the VS Code Activity Bar with the source control button, labeled with a branch icon, highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/githubdotdev-source-control-activity-bar-button.png)

2. To stage your changes, click <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="Stage changes" role="img"><path d="M7.75 2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75V7h4.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5H8.5v4.25a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0V8.5H2.75a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5H7V2.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.75 2Z"></path></svg> next to the file you've changed, or next to **Changes** if you've changed multiple files and you want to stage them all.

   ![Screenshot of the "Source control" side bar with the staging button (a plus sign), to the right of "Changes," highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/githubdotdev-codespaces-commit-stage.png)

3. In the text box, type a commit message describing the change you've made.

   ![Screenshot of the "Source control" side bar with a commit message entered into the text box above the "Commit" button.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/githubdotdev-codespaces-commit-message.png)

4. Click **Commit & Push**.

   Your changes are automatically be pushed to your branch on GitHub.

### Create a pull request

1. After you've committed changes to your local copy of the repository, click the pull request icon at the top of the "Source Control" side bar.

   ![Screenshot of the top of the "Source Control" side bar. The pull request icon is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/codespaces-commit-pr-button.png)

2. Check that the local branch and repository you're merging from, and the remote branch and repository you're merging into, are correct. Then give the pull request a title and a description.

   ![Screenshot of the "GitHub Pull Request" side bar with a form for creating a pull request, including "Title" and "Description" fields.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/codespaces-commit-pr.png)

3. Click **Create**.

### Working with an existing pull request

You can use VS Code for the Web to work with an existing pull request.

1. Browse to the pull request you'd like to open in VS Code for the Web.
2. Press `.` to open the pull request in VS Code for the Web.
3. Once you have made any changes, commit them using the steps in [Commit your changes](#commit-your-changes). Your changes will be committed directly to the branch, it's not necessary to push the changes.

## Using extensions

VS Code for the Web supports VS Code extensions that have been specifically created or updated to run in the web. These extensions are known as "web extensions". To learn how you can create a web extension or update your existing extension to work for the web, see [Web extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions) in the VS Code documentation.

Extensions that can run in VS Code for the Web will appear in the Extensions View and can be installed. If you use Settings Sync, any compatible extensions are also installed automatically. For information, see [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) in the VS Code documentation.
