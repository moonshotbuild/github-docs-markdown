# Deleting a codespace

You can delete a codespace you no longer need.

## Overview

GitHub Codespaces are automatically deleted after they have been stopped and have remained inactive for a defined number of days. The retention period for each codespace is set when the codespace is created and does not change. The default retention period is 30 days. See [Configuring automatic deletion of your codespaces](/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/configuring-automatic-deletion-of-your-codespaces?tool=webui).

You can manually delete a codespace in a variety of ways:

* In the terminal by using GitHub CLI
* In Visual Studio Code
* In your web browser

Use the tabs at the top of this article to display instructions for each of these ways of deleting a codespace.

> \[!NOTE]
> You can't delete a codespace from within JupyterLab.

## Why you should delete unused codespaces

There are costs associated with storing codespaces. You should therefore delete any codespaces you no longer need. See [GitHub Codespaces billing](/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces).

There are limits to the number of codespaces you can create, and the number of codespaces you can run at the same time. These limits vary based on a number of factors. If you reach the maximum number of codespaces and try to create another, a message is displayed telling you that you must remove an existing codespace before you can create a new one.

> You may have prebuild codespaces that are consuming additional storage which are not displayed on this dashboard. To delete them, follow the steps for “[Deleting a prebuild configuration](/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/managing-prebuilds#deleting-a-prebuild-configuration).”

<div class="ghd-tool vscode">

You can delete codespaces from within VS Code when you are not currently working in a codespace.

1. In VS Code, in the Activity Bar, click the Remote Explorer icon.

   ![Screenshot of the Activity Bar. The icon for the "Remote Explorer" side bar (a rectangle overlaid by a circle) is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/codespaces/click-remote-explorer-icon-vscode.png)

   > \[!NOTE]
   > If the Remote Explorer is not displayed in the Activity Bar:
   >
   > 1. Access the Command Palette. For example, by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows/Linux).
   > 2. Type: `details`.
   > 3. Click **Codespaces: Details**.
2. Under "GitHub Codespaces," right-click the codespace you want to delete.
3. Click **Delete Codespace**.

</div>

<div class="ghd-tool cli">

> \[!NOTE]
> To learn more about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

To delete a codespace use the `gh codespace delete` subcommand and then choose a codespace from the list that's displayed.

```shell
gh codespace delete
```

If you have unsaved changes, you'll be prompted to confirm deletion. You can use the `--force` flag to force deletion, avoiding this prompt.

For more information about this command, see [the GitHub CLI manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_codespace_delete).

## Bulk deleting codespaces

<div class="ghd-tool webui">

You can use GitHub CLI to delete several or all of your codespaces with a single command. For more information, click the "GitHub CLI" tab near the top of this page.

<div class="ghd-tool vscode">

You can use GitHub CLI to delete several or all of your codespaces with a single command. For more information, click the "GitHub CLI" tab near the top of this page.

</div>

<div class="ghd-tool cli">

You can delete several or all of your codespaces with a single command, using `gh codespace delete` followed by one of these flags:

`--all` - Delete all of your codespaces.

`--repo REPOSITORY` - Delete all of your codespaces for this repository. Or use together with the `--days` flag to filter by age of the codespace.

`--days NUMBER` - Delete all of your codespaces that are older than the specified number of days. Can be used together with the `--repo` flag.

By default you are prompted to confirm deletion of any codespaces that contain unsaved changes. You can use the `--force` flag to skip this confirmation.

### Example

Delete all of the codespaces for the `octo-org/octo-repo` repository that you created more than 7 days ago.

```shell
gh codespace delete --repo octo-org/octo-repo --days 7
```
