# Manage access for a migration from GitLab to GitHub

Set up the required access for migrating from GitLab to GitHub.

To migrate repositories from GitLab to GitHub, you need sufficient access to the **source** (a project on GitLab) and the **destination** (an organization on GitHub). After you complete the steps in this article, your access and permissions will be ready for your migration.

## Decide who will perform the migration

If the person who will perform the migration is **not** a GitHub organization owner, a GitHub organization owner must first grant them the migrator role.

* If you're a GitHub organization owner, and intend to perform the migration yourself, you can continue reading this guide.
* If you wish to assign the migrator role to someone else, do that now. Then, the migrator should perform the rest of the steps in these guides. See [Granting the migrator role](/en/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrate-from-gitlab/grant-the-migrator-role).

## Create a personal access token (classic) on GitHub

Next, you will need to create a personal access token (classic) which the GL2GH extension of the GitHub CLI will use to communicate with GitHub. The scopes that are required for your GitHub personal access token (classic) depend on your role and the task you want to complete.

> \[!NOTE]
> You can only use a personal access token (classic), not a fine-grained personal access token. This means that you cannot use GitHub Enterprise Importer if your organization uses the "Restrict personal access tokens (classic) from accessing your organizations" policy. For more information, see [Enforcing policies for personal access tokens in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/enforcing-policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-personal-access-tokens-in-your-enterprise#restricting-access-by-personal-access-tokens).

To learn how to create the token, see [Managing your personal access tokens](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

## Create a personal access token on GitLab

Your GitLab personal access token must have the `api` and `read_repository` scopes.

For self-managed GitLab instances, the token must belong to an **administrator**, so that the export is complete and user attribution is preserved.

To learn how to create the token, see [Personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens/) in the GitLab documentation.

## Configure IP allow lists on GitHub

If you use GitHub's IP allow list feature, you must add the GitHub IP ranges below to the allow list for the destination organization. See [Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization) or [Restricting network traffic to your enterprise with an IP allow list](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/configuring-settings/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/restricting-network-traffic-to-your-enterprise-with-an-ip-allow-list).

If your destination organization is on **GitHub.com**, you will need to allow the following IP addresses:

* 192.30.252.0/22
* 185.199.108.0/22
* 140.82.112.0/20
* 143.55.64.0/20
* 135.234.59.224/28 (added July 28, 2025)
* 2a0a:a440::/29
* 2606:50c0::/32
* 20.99.172.64/28 (added July 28, 2025)

If your destination organization is on **GHE.com**, the ranges you need to allow depend on your data residency region. You can get an up-to-date list of IP ranges used by GitHub Enterprise Importer with the `/meta` endpoint of the REST API. The `github_enterprise_importer` key in the response contains a list of IP ranges used for migrations.

## Allow migrations to bypass repository rulesets

If the destination organization or enterprise has rulesets enabled, the migrated repository's history may violate those rules. To allow the migration without disabling your rulesets, add "Repository migrations" to the bypass list for each applicable ruleset.  This bypass applies only during the migration. Once complete, rulesets will be enforced on all new contributions.

To configure the bypass:

1. Navigate to each enterprise or organization ruleset.
2. In the "Bypass list" section, click **Add bypass**.
3. Select **Repository migrations**.

For more information, see [Creating rulesets for repositories in your organization](/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/creating-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization) and [Setting ruleset bypasses for repository migrations](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/migrations/troubleshooting/setting-ruleset-bypasses-for-repository-migrations).

## Enable exports on GitLab

The GitLab projects you want to migrate must be enabled for exports. See [Enable project export](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/settings/import_and_export_settings/#enable-project-export) and [Sidekiq configuration for imports](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/sidekiq/configuration_for_imports/) in the GitLab documentation.
