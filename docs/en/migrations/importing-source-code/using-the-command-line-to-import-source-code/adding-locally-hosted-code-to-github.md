# Adding locally hosted code to GitHub

If your code is stored locally on your computer and is tracked by Git or not tracked by any version control system (VCS), you can import the code to GitHub using GitHub CLI or Git commands.

## About importing source code

Importing your source code to GitHub makes it easier for you and others to work together on projects and manage code. GitHub helps you collaborate, track changes, and organize tasks, making it simpler to build and manage projects. For more information, see [What is GitHub?](/en/get-started/start-your-journey/what-is-github).

> \[!WARNING]
> Never `git add`, `commit`, or `push` sensitive information, for example passwords or API keys, to a remote repository. If you've already added this information, see [Removing sensitive data from a repository](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).

### Adding existing source code to GitHub

If you have source code stored locally on your computer that is tracked by Git or not tracked by any version control system (VCS), you can add the code to GitHub by typing commands in a terminal. You can do this by typing Git commands directly. Alternatively, you can use GitHub CLI or GitHub Desktop.

#### Using GitHub CLI

GitHub CLI is an open source tool for using GitHub from your computer's command line. GitHub CLI can simplify the process of adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line. To learn more about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

#### Using GitHub Desktop

If you're most comfortable with a point-and-click user interface, consider adding your project with GitHub Desktop instead. For more information, see [Adding a repository from your local computer to GitHub Desktop](/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/adding-a-repository-from-your-local-computer-to-github-desktop).

### Converting repositories from other VCS

If your source code is tracked by a different VCS, such as Mercurial, Subversion, or Team Foundation Version Control, you must convert the repository to Git before you can add the project to GitHub.

* [Importing a Subversion repository](/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/importing-a-subversion-repository)
* [Importing a Mercurial repository](/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/importing-a-mercurial-repository)
* [Importing a Team Foundation Version Control repository](/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/importing-a-team-foundation-version-control-repository)

## Initializing a Git repository

If your locally-hosted code isn't tracked by any VCS, the first step is to initialize a Git repository. If your project is already tracked by Git, skip to [Importing a Git repository with the command line](#importing-a-git-repository-with-the-command-line).

1. Open <span class="platform-mac">Terminal</span><span class="platform-linux">Terminal</span><span class="platform-windows">Git Bash</span>.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.

3. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository. By default, the initial branch is called `main`.

   If you’re using Git 2.28.0 or a later version, you can set the name of the default branch using `-b`.

   ```shell
   git init -b main
   ```

   If you’re using Git 2.27.1 or an earlier version, you can set the name of the default branch using `git symbolic-ref`.

   ```shell
   git init && git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main
   ```

4. Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.

   ```shell
   $ git add .
   # Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
   ```

5. Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

   ```shell
   $ git commit -m "First commit"
   # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
   ```

## Importing a Git repository with the command line

After you've initialized a Git repository, you can push the repository to GitHub, using either GitHub CLI or Git.

* [Adding a local repository to GitHub with GitHub CLI](#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-with-github-cli)
* [Adding a local repository to GitHub using Git](#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-using-git)

### Adding a local repository to GitHub with GitHub CLI

1. To create a repository for your project on GitHub, use the `gh repo create` subcommand. When prompted, select **Push an existing local repository to GitHub** and enter the desired name for your repository. If you want your project to belong to an organization instead of your user account, specify the organization name and project name with `ORGANIZATION-NAME/PROJECT-NAME`.

2. Follow the interactive prompts. To add the remote and push the repository, confirm yes when asked to add the remote and push the commits to the current branch.

3. Alternatively, to skip all the prompts, supply the path to the repository with the `--source` flag and pass a visibility flag (`--public`, `--private`, or `--internal`). For example, `gh repo create --source=. --public`. Specify a remote with the `--remote` flag. To push your commits, pass the `--push` flag. For more information about possible arguments, see the [GitHub CLI manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create).

### Adding a local repository to GitHub using Git

Before you can add your local repository to GitHub using Git, you must authenticate to GitHub on the command line. For more information, see [About authentication to GitHub](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github#authenticating-with-the-command-line).

1. Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub. For more information, see [Creating a new repository](/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
