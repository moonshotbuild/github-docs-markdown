# About ghe-migrator

You can use ghe-migrator to transfer data from a source location (either a GitHub.com organization or a GitHub Enterprise Server instance) to a target GitHub Enterprise Server instance.

## Types of migrations

There are three types of migrations you can perform:

* A migration from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another existing GitHub Enterprise Server instance. You can migrate any number of repositories owned by any user or organization on the instance. Before performing a migration, you must have site administrator access to both instances.
* A migration from a GitHub.com organization to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance. You can migrate any number of repositories owned by the organization. Before performing a migration, you must have [administrative access](/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization) to the GitHub.com organization as well as site administrator access to the target instance.
* *Trial runs* are migrations that import data to a [staging instance](/en/enterprise-server@3.22/admin/installing-your-enterprise-server/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance/setting-up-a-staging-instance). These can be useful to see what *would* happen if a migration were applied to GitHub.com. **We strongly recommend that you perform a trial run on a staging instance before importing data to your production instance.**

> \[!NOTE]
> The use of ghe-migrator is **not recommended** for transferring a GitHub Enterprise Server instance between hypervisors. Instead, we suggest either backing up and restoring to the new location with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or creating a replica in the new location and then failing over to the replica appliance. For more information, see [About the backup service for GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server@3.22/admin/backing-up-and-restoring-your-instance/configuring-backups-on-your-instance), [Creating a high availability replica](/en/enterprise-server@3.22/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/configuring-high-availability/creating-a-high-availability-replica) and [Initiating a failover to your replica appliance](/en/enterprise-server@3.22/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/configuring-high-availability/initiating-a-failover-to-your-replica-appliance).

## Migrated data

With ghe-migrator, everything revolves around a repository. Most data associated with a repository can be migrated. For example, a repository within an organization will migrate the repository *and* the organization, as well as any users, teams, issues, and pull requests associated with the repository.

The items in the table below can be migrated with a repository. Any items not shown in the list of migrated data cannot be migrated, including Git LFS assets.

> \[!NOTE]
> Fork relationships do not persist after a migration.

## About migration of external authentication data

If the source location for your migration is a GitHub product that uses LDAP or SAML authentication, `ghe-migrator` does not migrate external authentication data linked to user accounts. For more information about authentication options, see "About authentication for your enterprise" in the [GitHub Enterprise Server docs](/en/enterprise-server@3.22/admin/concepts/identity-and-access-management/identity-and-access-management-fundamentals) or the [GitHub Enterprise Cloud docs](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/concepts/identity-and-access-management/identity-and-access-management-fundamentals).

If you migrate to a destination instance and then configure external authentication, users must sign in to the destination instance with a user account that has the same username or user ID as the account on the source instance. Administrators can review the external attribute that an instance uses to map user account names from the Management Console. For more information, see [Accessing the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server@3.22/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-web-ui/accessing-the-management-console).
