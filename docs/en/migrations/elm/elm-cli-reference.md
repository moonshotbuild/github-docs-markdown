>[!NOTE] Enterprise Live Migrations is in public preview and subject to change.

## `elm migration` commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `elm migration create` | Creates a new migration for a single source repository |
| `elm migration start --migration-id MIGRATION-ID` | Starts a migration |
| `elm migration status --migration-id MIGRATION-ID` | Shows the status, progress, cutover readiness, and timing of a migration |
| `elm migration list` | Lists all migrations and their statuses |
| `elm migration cancel --migration-id MIGRATION-ID` | Cancels a migration in progress |
| `elm migration cutover-to-destination --migration-id MIGRATION-ID` | Initiates the final cutover, archiving the source repository and completing the migration |

Some of these commands can take additional options. See the later sections in this article.

## `elm migration create` options

Create a new migration to prepare for repository export and import.

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--source-org` | Yes | N/A | Slug of the source organization on GitHub Enterprise Server |
| `--source-repo` | Yes | N/A | Name of the source repository |
| `--target-org` | Yes | N/A | Slug of the destination organization on GHE.com |
| `--target-repo` | Yes | N/A | Name of the destination repository |
| `--target-api` | Yes | N/A | The API URL for your destination enterprise (for example: `https://api.octocorp.ghe.com`). Do **not** include a trailing slash at the end of the URL. |
| `--pat-name` | Yes | N/A | This must be set to a static string: `system-pat` |
| `--target-visibility` | No | `internal` | Visibility of the destination repository. Must be `private` or `internal`. Public repositories are not supported. |
| `--start` | No | `false` | Automatically starts the migration after creating it |

## `elm migration list` options

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--status` | No | N/A | Filters results by migration status. Valid values: `created`, `queued`, `in_progress`, `paused`, `completed`, `failed`, `terminated`. |
| `--page-size` | No | N/A | Number of results per page |

## `elm migration cutover-to-destination` options
