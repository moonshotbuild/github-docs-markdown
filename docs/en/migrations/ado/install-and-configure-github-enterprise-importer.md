# Install and configure GitHub Enterprise Importer

Install the ADO2GH extension of the GitHub CLI and configure your environment for the migration.

## Step 1: Install the ADO2GH extension of the GitHub CLI

GitHub Enterprise Importer is a collection of extensions for GitHub CLI. If this is your first migration, you'll need to install GitHub CLI and the ADO2GH extension.

1. Install the GitHub CLI.
   * For installation instructions for GitHub CLI, see the [GitHub CLI repository](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation).
   * If you already have GitHub CLI installed, run `gh --version` to ensure you're running version 2.4.0 or newer. If you have an older version, visit the [GitHub CLI repository](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) for upgrade instructions.

2. Install the ADO2GH extension.

   ```shell copy
   gh extension install github/gh-ado2gh
   ```

3. The ADO2GH extension of the GitHub CLI is updated weekly. To make sure you're using the latest version, update the extension.

   ```shell copy
   gh extension upgrade github/gh-ado2gh
   ```

Any time you need help with the ADO2GH extension, you can use the `--help` flag with a command. For example, `gh ado2gh --help` will list all the available commands, and `gh ado2gh migrate-repo --help` will list all the options available for the `migrate-repo` command.

## Step 2: Set environment variables

Before you can use the ADO2GH extension to migrate to GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you must create personal access tokens that can access the source and destination organizations, then set the personal access tokens as environment variables.

1. Make sure you have your personal access tokens for both GitHub and Azure DevOps ready. See [Manage access](/en/migrations/ado/manage-access?token-backtrack#create-a-personal-access-token-classic-on-github) if you haven't already created a token.

2. Set environment variables for the personal access tokens, replacing TOKEN in the commands below with the personal access tokens you previously created. Use `GH_PAT` for the destination organization and `ADO_PAT` for the source organization.

   * If you're using Terminal, use the `export` command.

     ```shell copy
     export GH_PAT="TOKEN"
     export ADO_PAT="TOKEN"
     ```

   * If you're using PowerShell, use the `$env` command.

     ```shell copy
     $env:GH_PAT="TOKEN"
     $env:ADO_PAT="TOKEN"
     ```

3. If you're migrating to GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, for convenience, set an environment variable for the **base API URL** for your enterprise.

   Ensure you replace `SUBDOMAIN` with your enterprise's subdomain. For example, if your enterprise's subdomain is `acme`, the `TARGET_API_URL` value would be `https://api.acme.ghe.com`.

   * If you're using Terminal, use the `export` command.

     ```shell copy
     export TARGET_API_URL="https://api.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com"
     ```

   * If you're using PowerShell, use the `$env` command.

     ```shell copy
     $env:TARGET_API_URL="https://api.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com"
     ```

   You'll use this variable with the `--target-api-url` option in commands you run with the GitHub CLI.
