# Other

Reference documentation for GraphQL schema types in the Other category.

## Base64String - scalar

A (potentially binary) string encoded using base64.

## BigInt - scalar

Represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Since the value may
exceed the size of a 32-bit integer, it's encoded as a string.

## Boolean - scalar

Represents true or false values.

## CustomPropertyValue - scalar

A custom property value can be either a string or an array of strings. All
property types support only a single string value, except for the multi-select
type, which supports only a string array.

## Date - scalar

An ISO-8601 encoded date string.

## DateTime - scalar

An ISO-8601 encoded UTC date string.

## Float - scalar

Represents signed double-precision fractional values as specified by IEEE 754.

## GitObjectID - scalar

A Git object ID.

## GitRefname - scalar

A fully qualified reference name (e.g. refs/heads/master).

## GitSSHRemote - scalar

Git SSH string.

## GitTimestamp - scalar

An ISO-8601 encoded date string. Unlike the DateTime type, GitTimestamp is not converted in UTC.

## HTML - scalar

A string containing HTML code.

## id - query

ID of the object.

**Type:** ID!

## ID - scalar

Represents a unique identifier that is Base64 obfuscated. It is often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as "VXNlci0xMA==") or integer (such as 4) input value will be accepted as an ID.

## Int - scalar

Represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.

## IssueTimelineItemsItemType - enum

The possible item types found in a timeline.
