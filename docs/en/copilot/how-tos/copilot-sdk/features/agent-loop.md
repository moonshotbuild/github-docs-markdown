# The agent loop

How the Copilot CLI processes a user message end-to-end: from prompt to session.idle.

## Architecture

![Diagram: Graph diagram showing the described process.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-sdk/features-agent-loop-diagram-0.png)

The **SDK** is a transport layer—it sends your prompt to the **Copilot CLI** over JSON-RPC and surfaces events back to your app. The **CLI** is the orchestrator that runs the agentic tool-use loop, making one or more LLM API calls until the task is done.

## The tool-use loop

When you call `session.send({ prompt })`, the CLI enters a loop:

![Diagram: Flowchart showing the described process.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-sdk/features-agent-loop-diagram-1.png)

The model sees the **full conversation history** on each call—system prompt, user message, and all prior tool calls and results.

**Key insight:** Each iteration of this loop is exactly one LLM API call, visible as one `assistant.turn_start` / `assistant.turn_end` pair in the event log. There are no hidden calls.

## Turns—what they are

A **turn** is a single LLM API call and its consequences:

1. The CLI sends the conversation history to the LLM
2. The LLM responds (possibly with tool requests)
3. If tools were requested, the CLI executes them
4. `assistant.turn_end` is emitted

A single user message typically results in **multiple turns**. For example, a question like "how does X work in this codebase?" might produce:

| Turn | What the model does                            | toolRequests?    |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1    | Calls `grep` and `glob` to search the codebase | ✅ Yes            |
| 2    | Reads specific files based on search results   | ✅ Yes            |
| 3    | Reads more files for deeper context            | ✅ Yes            |
| 4    | Produces the final text answer                 | ❌ No → loop ends |

The model decides on each turn whether to request more tools or produce a final answer. Each call sees the **full accumulated context** (all prior tool calls and results), so it can make an informed decision about whether it has enough information.

## Event flow for a multi-turn interaction

![Diagram: Flowchart showing the described process.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-sdk/features-agent-loop-diagram-2.png)

## Who triggers each turn?

| Actor           | Responsibility                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Your app**    | Sends the initial prompt via `session.send()`                                             |
| **Copilot CLI** | Runs the tool-use loop—executes tools and feeds results back to the LLM for the next turn |
| **LLM**         | Decides whether to request tools (continue looping) or produce a final response (stop)    |
| **SDK**         | Passes events through; does not control the loop                                          |

The CLI is purely mechanical: "model asked for tools → execute → call model again." The **model** is the decision-maker for when to stop.

## `session.idle` vs `session.task_complete`

These are two different completion signals with very different guarantees:

### `session.idle`

* **Always emitted** when the tool-use loop ends
* **Ephemeral**: not persisted to disk, not replayed on session resume
* Means: "the agent has stopped processing and is ready for the next message"
* **Use this** as your reliable "done" signal

The SDK's `sendAndWait()` method waits for this event:

```typescript
// Blocks until session.idle fires
const response = await session.sendAndWait({ prompt: "Fix the bug" });
```

### `session.task_complete`

* **Optionally emitted**: requires the model to explicitly signal it
* **Persisted**: saved to the session event log on disk
* Means: "the agent considers the overall task fulfilled"
* Carries an optional `summary` field

```typescript
session.on("session.task_complete", (event) => {
    console.log("Task done:", event.data.summary);
});
```

### Autopilot mode: the CLI nudges for `task_complete`

In **autopilot mode** (headless/autonomous operation), the CLI actively tracks whether the model has called `task_complete`. If the tool-use loop ends without it, the CLI injects a synthetic user message nudging the model:

> *"You have not yet marked the task as complete using the task\_complete tool. If you were planning, stop planning and start implementing. You aren't done until you have fully completed the task."*

This effectively restarts the tool-use loop—the model sees the nudge as a new user message and continues working. The nudge also instructs the model **not** to call `task_complete` prematurely:

* Don't call it if you have open questions—make decisions and keep working
* Don't call it if you hit an error—try to resolve it
* Don't call it if there are remaining steps—complete them first

This creates a **two-level completion mechanism** in autopilot:

1. The model calls `task_complete` with a summary → CLI emits `session.task_complete` → done
2. The model stops without calling it → CLI nudges → model continues or calls `task_complete`

### Why `task_complete` might not appear

In **interactive mode** (normal chat), the CLI does not nudge for `task_complete`. The model may skip it entirely. Common reasons:

* **Conversational Q\&A**: The model answers a question and simply stops—there's no discrete "task" to complete
* **Model discretion**: The model produces a final text response without calling the task-complete signal
* **Interrupted sessions**: The session ends before the model reaches a completion point

The CLI emits `session.idle` regardless, because it's a mechanical signal (the loop ended), not a semantic one (the model thinks it's done).

### Which should you use?

| Use case                                  | Signal                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "Wait for the agent to finish processing" | `session.idle` ✅                      |
| "Know when a coding task is done"         | `session.task_complete` (best-effort) |
| "Timeout/error handling"                  | `session.idle` + `session.error` ✅    |

## Counting LLM calls

The number of `assistant.turn_start` / `assistant.turn_end` pairs in the event log equals the total number of LLM API calls made. There are no hidden calls for planning, evaluation, or completion checking.

To inspect turn count for a session:

```bash
# Count turns in a session's event log
grep -c "assistant.turn_start" ~/.copilot/session-state/<sessionId>/events.jsonl
```
