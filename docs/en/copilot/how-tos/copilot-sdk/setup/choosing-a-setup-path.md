# Setup guides

These guides walk you through configuring the Copilot SDK for your specific use case—from personal side projects to production platforms serving thousands of users.

## Architecture at a glance

Every Copilot SDK integration follows the same core pattern: your application talks to the SDK, which communicates with the Copilot CLI over JSON-RPC. What changes across setups is **where the CLI runs**, **how users authenticate**, and **how sessions are managed**.

The setup guides below help you configure each layer for your scenario.

## Who are you?

### 🧑‍💻 Hobbyist

You're building a personal assistant, side project, or experimental app. You want the simplest path to getting Copilot in your code.

**Start with:**

1. **[Default setup (bundled CLI)](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/bundled-cli)**—The SDK includes the CLI automatically—just install and go
2. **[Local CLI setup](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/local-cli)**—Use your own CLI binary or running instance (advanced)

### 🏢 Internal app developer

You're building tools for your team or company. Users are employees who need to authenticate with their enterprise GitHub accounts or org memberships.

**Start with:**

1. **[GitHub OAuth setup](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/github-oauth)**—Let employees sign in with their GitHub accounts
2. **[Backend services setup](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/backend-services)**—Run the SDK in your internal services

**If scaling beyond a single server:**

1. **[Multi-tenancy and server deployments](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/multi-tenancy)**—Configure SDK options for multi-user server mode
2. **[Scaling and multi-tenancy](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/scaling)**—Handle multiple users and services

### 🚀 App developer (ISV)

You're building a product for customers. You need to handle authentication for your users—either through GitHub or by managing identity yourself.

**Start with:**

1. **[GitHub OAuth setup](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/github-oauth)**—Let customers sign in with GitHub
2. **[BYOK (bring your own key)](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/auth/byok)**—Manage identity yourself with your own model keys
3. **[Backend services setup](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/backend-services)**—Power your product from server-side code

**For production:**

1. **[Multi-tenancy and server deployments](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/multi-tenancy)**—Use `mode: "empty"`, per-session tokens, and isolated runtime state
2. **[Scaling and multi-tenancy](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/scaling)**—Serve many customers reliably

### 🏗️ Platform developer

You're embedding Copilot into a platform—APIs, developer tools, or infrastructure that other developers build on. You need fine-grained control over sessions, scaling, and multi-tenancy.

**Start with:**

1. **[Backend services setup](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/backend-services)**—Core server-side integration
2. **[Multi-tenancy and server deployments](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/multi-tenancy)**—SDK-level isolation, per-session auth, and shared runtime options
3. **[Scaling and multi-tenancy](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/scaling)**—Session isolation, horizontal scaling, persistence

**Depending on your auth model:**

1. **[GitHub OAuth setup](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/github-oauth)**—For GitHub-authenticated users
2. **[BYOK (bring your own key)](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/auth/byok)**—For self-managed identity and model access

## Configuration comparison

![Diagram: Flowchart showing the described process.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-sdk/setup-choosing-a-setup-path-diagram-1.png)

## Prerequisites

All guides assume you have:

* **One of the SDKs** installed (Node.js, Python, and .NET SDKs include the CLI automatically):
  * Node.js: `npm install @github/copilot-sdk`
  * Python: `pip install github-copilot-sdk`
  * Go: `go get github.com/github/copilot-sdk/go` (requires separate CLI installation)
  * .NET: `dotnet add package GitHub.Copilot.SDK`

If you're brand new, start with the **[Build your first Copilot-powered app](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/getting-started)** first, then come back here for production configuration.
