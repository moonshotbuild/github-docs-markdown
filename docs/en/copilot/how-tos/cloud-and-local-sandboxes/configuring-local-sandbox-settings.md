# Configuring local sandbox settings

Use the /sandbox slash command in Copilot CLI to control how the local sandbox restricts filesystem access, network connectivity, and system capabilities.

> \[!NOTE]
> Local sandboxes for GitHub Copilot are in public preview and subject to change.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Local sandboxing on Windows requires a Windows Insiders build.

## About local sandbox configuration

You can use the `/sandbox` slash command to grant extra paths, adjust network access, or turn sandboxing on or off.

For a conceptual overview of cloud and local sandboxes for Copilot, see [About cloud and local sandboxes for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/concepts/about-cloud-and-local-sandboxes).

## Opening the sandbox configuration

1. Start a Copilot CLI session.
2. Enter the `/sandbox` slash command.

   This opens an interactive configuration interface with four tabs: **General**, **Auth**, **Filesystem**, and **Network**. Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch between tabs. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to save your changes and close the configuration.

## Configuring general settings

The **General** tab controls the top-level sandbox behavior. When enterprise managed settings enforce a value, the dialog labels the setting as `(managed)` and prevents you from changing it.

| Setting                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable sandbox**       | Run shell commands inside the sandbox. You can also toggle this with `/sandbox enable` and `/sandbox disable`.                                                                                    |
| **Allow sandbox bypass** | Let the model request that individual commands run outside the sandbox, subject to approval. Turned on by default. For more information, see [Allowing sandbox bypass](#allowing-sandbox-bypass). |
| **Sandbox MCP servers**  | Run MCP servers inside the sandbox. Turned on by default.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Sandbox LSP servers**  | Run language servers (LSP servers) inside the sandbox. Turned on by default.                                                                                                                      |

### Allowing sandbox bypass

The **Allow sandbox bypass** setting controls what happens when Copilot can't run a command successfully inside the sandbox.

* **On (default)**: If a command fails inside the sandbox, you are prompted to allow Copilot to run the command outside the sandbox. Your response to this prompt applies to this specific attempt to run the command. Optionally, you can choose to disable the sandbox for the rest of the session (if permitted by your enterprise), or you can enter an instruction for Copilot to work on instead.
* **Off**: If Copilot can't run a command successfully in the sandbox, it stops working on the task and reports the failure.

## Configuring authentication settings

The **Auth** tab controls whether your credentials are made available to commands running inside the sandbox. As on the other tabs, an enterprise-managed value is shown as `(managed)` and can't be changed.

| Setting                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authenticate git**      | Inject a GitHub token so authenticated HTTPS `git` works inside the sandbox without a credential helper. For non-GitHub hosts, your own stored credentials are made available to sandboxed `git` commands instead. Turned on by default. |
| **Authenticate gh**       | Export `GH_TOKEN` so that GitHub CLI (note: the `gh` CLI, not `copilot`) works inside the sandbox without reaching its stored credentials (configuration directory or OS keychain), which the sandbox blocks. Turned on by default.      |
| **Allow keychain access** | Available on macOS only. Let sandboxed commands use the macOS Keychain—for example, to access credentials used by `git` and `gh` credential helpers. Turned off by default.                                                              |

## Configuring filesystem settings

The **Filesystem** tab controls which directories and files the sandboxed process can access.

By default, Copilot is granted read/write permission to everything in and below the current working directory. If you are in a Git repository, Copilot is also granted:

* Read/write permission to everything in and below the repository's `.git` directory.
* Read permission for everything else in the repository above the current working directory. The working directory itself stays read/write, because the more specific grant wins where the two overlap.

| Setting                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Include working directory** | Turned on by default. The current working directory (and the enclosing repository's `.git` directory, if any) is automatically added to the list of read/write paths. Unselect this option if you don't want the working directory to be granted read/write access automatically, and then manually allow access to specific paths.                                                                       |
| **Allow dev tool access**     | Turned on by default. Grants sandboxed commands read access to developer-tool configuration and caches—including package-manager registries and the tokens they store—and read/write access to shared build caches, so installs and builds work inside the sandbox. This appears as **dev-tool access** in the `/sandbox policy` report. Turn it off to require these locations to be granted explicitly. |

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Unselecting **Include working directory** removes access to everything in and below the `.git` directory of a Git repository. As a result, Git operations such as `status`, `add`, `commit`, and `diff` will fail unless you manually add access for this directory.

### Adding filesystem path rules

You can specify paths that you want to add to the sandbox. This allows you to grant read-only or read/write access to directories and files outside the working directory. You can also deny access, to exclude directories and files from the sandbox.

1. In the **Filesystem** tab, press <kbd>A</kbd> to add a new path rule.

2. Type a file or directory path. Use an absolute path—for example, `/Users/octocat/projects/app` on macOS or Linux, or `C:\Users\octocat\projects\app` on Windows. Then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   > \[!NOTE]
   > Adding a directory includes its entire subtree. Wildcards are not supported.

3. Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate between the permissions options: **Read/Write**, **Read-Only**, **Denied**. Then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select an option.

After you have added filesystem paths, you can edit or delete them.

1. Use the up and down arrow keys to select a path.
2. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to edit the path, or <kbd>D</kbd> to delete it.

## Configuring network settings

The **Network** tab controls whether sandboxed processes can make network connections.

| Setting                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allow outbound connections** | Turned on by default. When turned on, the sandboxed process can reach external hosts on the internet. Turn this off to fully isolate the sandbox from the network.                                                                             |
| **Allow local network**        | Turned on by default. When turned on, the sandboxed process can reach hosts on your local network (for example, `localhost` or other devices on your LAN). Turn this off to block the sandbox from reaching local or private network services. |
| **HTTP Proxy**                 | Route the sandbox's outbound traffic through an HTTP proxy. See [Routing traffic through an HTTP proxy](#routing-traffic-through-an-http-proxy).                                                                                               |

### Routing traffic through an HTTP proxy

Select **HTTP Proxy** on the **Network** tab to send the sandbox's outbound traffic through a proxy server. Enter the proxy **URL**, and optionally a **Username** and **Password**. To remove the proxy, clear the URL.

Keep the following in mind:

* The proxy applies only while **Allow outbound connections** is turned on. If you turn outbound connections off, the proxy is kept in your settings but stays inactive.
* The password is stored securely in your operating system's credential store. You can also enter a `${VAR}` environment-variable reference instead of a literal password.
* On Linux and macOS, the proxy is cooperative: it is applied through standard proxy environment variables and depends on each tool honoring them. On Windows, the sandbox enforces the proxy.
* Your organization can enforce the proxy URL through managed settings. When it does, the URL is shown as `(managed)`, but you can still provide your own credentials, which are stored in your user settings.

## Enabling and disabling the sandbox quickly

You can toggle the sandbox on or off without opening the full configuration interface:

* **Enable**: Enter `/sandbox enable` in the Copilot CLI session.
* **Disable**: Enter `/sandbox disable` in the Copilot CLI session.

These commands change the **Enable sandbox** setting on the **General** tab.

## Viewing your current sandbox settings

Settings are stored in `settings.json` under the `sandbox` key in your Copilot CLI configuration directory. For more information about the configuration directory, see [GitHub Copilot CLI configuration directory](/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-config-dir-reference).

You can view your current sandbox settings from within a Copilot CLI session.

1. Enter `/settings`.
2. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to search for settings.
3. Type `sandbox` to filter the list of settings.

The steps above show your saved settings. To see the **effective** filesystem policy—the read/write, read-only, and denied paths that result once your settings, the automatic grants, and any managed policy are combined—enter `/sandbox policy`. For more information, see [Understanding filesystem policies for local sandboxing in GitHub Copilot CLI](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/understanding-local-sandboxing).
