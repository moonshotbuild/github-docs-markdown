# Adding agent skills for GitHub Copilot CLI

Modify Copilot's behavior and abilities when it works on particular tasks.

Agent skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Copilot can load when relevant to improve its performance in specialized tasks. For more information, see [About agent skills](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills).

## Creating and adding a skill

To create an agent skill, you write a `SKILL.md` file and, optionally, other resources, such as supplementary Markdown files, or scripts, which you reference in the `SKILL.md` instructions.

1. If you haven't already done so, create a `skills` directory in one of the following locations. This is where you will locate your skill, and any others you may want to create in the future.

   For **project skills**, specific to a single repository, create a `.github/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.agents/skills` directory in your repository.

   For **personal skills**, shared across projects, create a `~/.copilot/skills` or `~/.agents/skills` directory in your local home directory.

2. Within the `skills` directory, create a subdirectory for your new skill. Each skill should have its own directory (for example, `.github/skills/webapp-testing`).

   Skill subdirectory names should be lowercase and use hyphens for spaces.

3. In your skill subdirectory, create a `SKILL.md` file containing your skill's instructions.

   > \[!IMPORTANT]
   > Skill files must be named `SKILL.md`.

   `SKILL.md` files are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. In their simplest form, they include:

   * YAML frontmatter
     * **name** (required): A unique identifier for the skill. This must be lowercase, using hyphens for spaces. Typically, this matches the name of the skill's directory.
     * **description** (required): A description of what the skill does, and when Copilot should use it.
     * **license** (optional): A description of the license that applies to this skill.
   * A Markdown body, with the instructions, examples and guidelines for Copilot to follow.

4. Optionally, add scripts, examples or other resources to your skill's directory.

   For more information, see "[Enabling a skill to run a script](#enabling-a-skill-to-run-a-script)."

### Example `SKILL.md` file

For a **project skill**, this file would be located in a `.github/skills/github-actions-failure-debugging` directory of your repository.

For a **personal skill**, this file would be located in a `~/.copilot/skills/github-actions-failure-debugging` directory.

```markdown copy
---
name: github-actions-failure-debugging
description: Guide for debugging failing GitHub Actions workflows. Use this when asked to debug failing GitHub Actions workflows.
---

To debug failing GitHub Actions workflows in a pull request, follow this process, using tools provided from the GitHub MCP Server:

1. Use the `list_workflow_runs` tool to look up recent workflow runs for the pull request and their status
2. Use the `summarize_job_log_failures` tool to get an AI summary of the logs for failed jobs, to understand what went wrong without filling your context windows with thousands of lines of logs
3. If you still need more information, use the `get_job_logs` or `get_workflow_run_logs` tool to get the full, detailed failure logs
4. Try to reproduce the failure yourself in your own environment.
5. Fix the failing build. If you were able to reproduce the failure yourself, make sure it is fixed before committing your changes.
```

### Enabling a skill to run a script

When a skill is invoked, Copilot automatically discovers all of the files in the skill's directory and makes them available alongside the skill's instructions. This means you can include scripts or other resources in the skill directory and reference them in your `SKILL.md` instructions.

To create a skill that runs a script:

1. **Add the script to your skill's directory.** For example, a skill for converting SVG images to PNG might have the following structure.

   ```text
   .github/skills/image-convert/
   ├── SKILL.md
   └── convert-svg-to-png.sh
   ```

2. **Optionally pre-approve the tools the skill needs.** In your `SKILL.md` frontmatter, you can use the `allowed-tools` field to list the tools Copilot may use without asking for confirmation each time. If a tool is not listed in the `allowed-tools` field, Copilot will prompt you for permission before using it.

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: image-convert
   description: Converts SVG images to PNG format. Use when asked to convert SVG files.
   allowed-tools: shell
   ---
   ```

   > \[!WARNING]
   > Only pre-approve the `shell` or `bash` tools if you have reviewed this skill and any referenced scripts, and you fully trust their source. Pre-approving `shell` or `bash` removes the confirmation step for running terminal commands and can allow attacker-controlled skills or prompt injections to execute arbitrary commands in your environment. When in doubt, omit `shell` and `bash` from `allowed-tools` so that Copilot must ask for your explicit confirmation before running terminal commands.

3. **Write instructions that tell Copilot how to use the script.** In the Markdown body of `SKILL.md`, describe when and how to run the script.

   ```markdown
   When asked to convert an SVG to PNG, run the `convert-svg-to-png.sh` script
   from this skill's base directory, passing the input SVG file path as the
   first argument.
   ```

## Adding a skill that someone else has created

In addition to creating your own skills, you can also add skills that other people have created.

> \[!TIP]
> You can also use `gh skill` in GitHub CLI to search for, install, update, and publish agent skills. For more information, see [Adding agent skills for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/add-skills#managing-skills-with-github-cli).

1. Download a skill directory (that is, a directory containing a SKILL.md file and, optionally, other files and subdirectories).

   For example, download a skill from the Awesome GitHub Copilot repository: <https://awesome-copilot.github.com/skills/>.

2. If you downloaded a `.zip` file, unzip this.

3. Move the skill directory to the required location:

   * For **project skills**, specific to a single repository: `.github/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.agents/skills` in your repository.

   * For **personal skills**, shared across projects: `~/.copilot/skills` or `~/.agents/skills` in your local home directory.

4. Start a CLI session, or if you are currently in a CLI session enter `/skills reload`.

5. Enter `/skills info SKILL-NAME` to check that the skill has reloaded.

   SKILL-NAME is defined in the SKILL.md file and is typically the same as the name of the skill directory.

## Using agent skills

When performing tasks, Copilot will decide when to use your skills based on your prompt and the skill's description.

When Copilot chooses to use a skill, the `SKILL.md` file will be injected in the agent's context, giving the agent access to your instructions. It can then follow those instructions and use any scripts or examples you may have included in the skill's directory.

To tell Copilot to use a specific skill, include the skill name in your prompt, preceded by a forward slash. For example, if you have a skill named "frontend-design" you could use a prompt such as:

```copilot
Use the /frontend-design skill to create a responsive navigation bar in React.
```

### Skills commands in the CLI

* **List the currently available skills:** use the command `/skills list` or the prompt:

  ```copilot
  What skills do you have?
  ```

* **Enable or disable specific skills:** use the command `/skills` and then use the up and down keys on your keyboard, and the space bar, to toggle skills on or off.

* **Find out more about a skill** (including its location): use the command `/skills info`.

* **Add a skills location:** to add an alternative location in which to store skills, use the command `/skills add`.

* **Reload skills:** if you have added a skill during a CLI session, you can add it using the command `/skills reload` to avoid having to restart the CLI to use it.

* **Remove skills:** to remove a skill that you have added directly—not via a plugin—use the command `/skills remove SKILL-DIRECTORY`. To remove skills added as part of a plugin you must manage the plugin itself. Use the `info` subcommand to find out which plugin a skill came from.

The `/skills` commands above run inside an interactive session. The same list, add, and remove operations are also available from the terminal command line by using the `copilot skill` subcommand. This is useful for scripting or for setting up skills before you start a session. For example, run `copilot skill list` to list your skills, or `copilot skill add <FILE | URL | DIRECTORY>` to add one. For the full set of subcommands for Copilot CLI, see [GitHub Copilot CLI command reference](/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-command-reference).

## Skills versus custom instructions

You can use both skills and custom instructions to teach Copilot how to work in your repository and how to perform specific tasks.

We recommend using **custom instructions** for simple instructions relevant to almost every task (for example information about your repository's coding standards), and **skills** for more detailed instructions that Copilot should only access when relevant.

To learn more about repository custom instructions, see [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions).

To learn more about how skills differ from other customization features, see [Comparing GitHub Copilot CLI customization features](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/comparing-cli-features).
