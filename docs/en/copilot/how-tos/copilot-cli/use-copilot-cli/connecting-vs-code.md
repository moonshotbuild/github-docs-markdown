# Connecting GitHub Copilot CLI to VS Code

Connect Copilot CLI to VS Code to share context, trust settings, and output.

Connecting Copilot CLI to VS Code gives you the best of both environments: the speed and flexibility of a terminal-based workflow, combined with the rich visual tools of your editor. With a connection established, you can:

* **Use your editor selection as context** — Select code in VS Code and reference it directly in CLI prompts, without needing to specify file paths or line numbers.
* **Review proposed changes as diffs** — When Copilot suggests file edits, they appear as a side-by-side diff in VS Code so you can review, accept, or reject each change visually.
* **Surface live diagnostics** — Copilot can access real-time errors and warnings from VS Code, so it can find and fix problems that your editor has already detected.
* **Pick up sessions across tools** — View CLI session transcripts in VS Code and resume them in the integrated terminal without losing context.

## Connecting to VS Code

Copilot CLI can automatically connect to VS Code when you start a CLI session. Additionally, during an interactive session, you can choose to connect to any workspace that is currently open in VS Code on the local machine.

### Automatic connection at startup

When you start Copilot CLI, it checks whether the current working directory from which you started the CLI matches any workspace folder you have open in VS Code in trusted mode. If there is a match, the CLI connects to the relevant VS Code instance. The connection happens regardless of where you are using Copilot CLI: in a built-in terminal in VS Code, or in an external terminal application running in a separate window.

If Copilot CLI successfully connects to VS Code, the environment message that's displayed at startup will include either "Visual Studio Code connected" or "Visual Studio Code - Insiders connected."

If you have the same workspace open in more than one VS Code window, the CLI connects to one of them automatically. It cannot connect to multiple IDE instances at the same time. If you prefer to connect to a different instance of VS Code, you can switch by using the `/ide` command.

> \[!NOTE]
> If you are using GitHub Codespaces, a CLI session running locally cannot connect to a VS Code workspace running in the remote codespace. You can, however, connect when you use the CLI inside the codespace—that is, within VS Code's built-in terminal or in an SSH session on the remote codespace host.

### Manual connection during an interactive session

If you open a workspace in VS Code after starting Copilot CLI, or if you started the CLI from a directory that doesn't match any open workspace, you can use the `/ide` slash command to manually connect to a VS Code workspace. The workspace you want to connect to must be currently open in trusted mode in VS Code.

## Managing the connection with the `/ide` slash command

Use the `/ide` slash command in an interactive Copilot CLI session to:

* **View** the current connection status—for example, if you want to check which workspace is currently connected.
* **Connect** to a different VS Code workspace.
* **Disconnect** from VS Code.

You can also toggle the following settings from the `/ide` menu:

* **Auto-connect to matching IDE workspace**—controls whether the CLI automatically connects to a matching VS Code workspace at startup.
* **Open file edit diffs in IDE**—controls whether proposed file changes are shown as diffs in a VS Code editor tab.

## Using VS Code context in prompts

When Copilot CLI is connected to VS Code, it receives your current editor selection whenever the selection changes. The selection is displayed under your prompt in the CLI, aligned to the right. This selection indicator is updated whenever you select different code in VS Code.

This allows you to select some code in VS Code and then use a prompt such as:

```copilot
Debug this
```

Alternatively, you can select some code but ask Copilot about the whole file:

```copilot
Explain this file
```

## Reviewing file changes as diffs

When you ask Copilot to make changes to a file in the workspace, VS Code displays the proposed changes as a diff in a new editor tab. This makes it easy to see exactly what Copilot is proposing. Use the accept (✓) or reject (✗) buttons in the top-right of the diff view to apply or discard the changes. Once you accept or reject the diff, the pending file-edit permission is resolved and the CLI continues its workflow.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> * The diff view is not shown if you have allowed Copilot to edit files without your approval—for example, using the `--allow-all` or `--yolo` command-line options, or the `/allow-all` or `/yolo` slash commands. Instead, the proposed changes are applied directly to the file in the workspace without showing a diff, and the CLI continues immediately with the updated file content.
> * If you prefer not to use the diff view in VS Code you can turn this feature off in the `/ide` menu. When you turn this off, the proposed file changes are displayed in the CLI.

## Viewing and resuming CLI sessions in VS Code

You can read the transcript of any Copilot CLI session for the current workspace from within VS Code.

1. Open the **Copilot Chat** side bar in VS Code.

2. Click the Sessions icon (<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: middle;"><path d="M12.5 1H3.5C2.122 1 1 2.122 1 3.5V12.5C1 13.879 2.122 15 3.5 15H12.5C13.878 15 15 13.879 15 12.5V3.5C15 2.122 13.878 1 12.5 1ZM2 12.5V3.5C2 2.673 2.673 2 3.5 2H9V14H3.5C2.673 14 2 13.327 2 12.5ZM14 12.5C14 13.327 13.327 14 12.5 14H10V2H12.5C13.327 2 14 2.673 14 3.5V12.5Z"/></svg>) at the top right of the Chat panel to display the Sessions view.

   The Sessions view lists your most recent Copilot sessions, with the most recent at the top.

3. Click a session to read the full input and output text. For CLI sessions, the transcript is identical to what was displayed in the terminal during that session.

If you have run a CLI session for the current workspace that you have not yet viewed in the Sessions view, a dot icon and an unread count are shown next to the Chat icon in the VS Code title bar. Click it to toggle a filtered list of unread sessions. Click it again to clear the filter and view all sessions.

To continue a CLI session in VS Code's integrated terminal, right-click the session in the Sessions view and choose **Resume in Terminal**. This is a quick way to pick up work from an external terminal window without losing any session context.
