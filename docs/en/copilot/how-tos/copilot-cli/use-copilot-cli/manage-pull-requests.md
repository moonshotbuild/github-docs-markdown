# Managing pull requests with the /pr command

Use the /pr slash command to view, create, and fix pull requests directly from Copilot CLI.

## Overview

The `/pr` slash command lets you manage the full pull request lifecycle without leaving your terminal. You can check pull request status, create new pull requests, and fix common issues such as review feedback, merge conflicts, and CI failures.

## Prerequisite

You must be working in a Git repository that is hosted on GitHub.

## Subcommands

The `/pr` slash command has several subcommands that you can use to perform different actions on your pull requests.

> \[!NOTE]
> All `/pr` subcommands relate to the current branch—for example, fixing failing CI checks for the pull request associated with the current branch.

Subcommands that commit and push changes will prompt you for permission before performing potentially destructive actions, unless you have pre-allowed those tools. For more information, see [Allowing and denying tool use](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli/allowing-tools).

## Viewing pull request status

To check the status of the pull request associated with your current branch, enter the following in an interactive session:

```copilot copy
/pr
```

### Opening the pull request in your browser

If you want to view the pull request on GitHub.com instead of in the terminal, enter:

```copilot copy
/pr view web
```

This opens the pull request URL in your default browser.

## Creating a pull request

To create a pull request from your current branch, enter:

```copilot copy
/pr create
```

Copilot ensures that all local commits are pushed to the remote branch, then creates the pull request. If a pull request template exists in the repository, Copilot follows it when generating the pull request title and description.

If a pull request already exists for the current branch, `/pr create` updates the existing pull request instead of creating a new one.

### Adding instructions for pull request creation

You can append instructions after `/pr create` to guide Copilot. For example:

```copilot copy
/pr create prefix the PR title 'Project X: '
```

## Fixing review feedback

To have Copilot read and address review comments on your pull request, enter:

```copilot copy
/pr fix feedback
```

Copilot fetches all review comment threads on the pull request, determines what changes are requested, applies the changes to your codebase, and commits and pushes the fixes. Actionable code change requests are prioritized over conversational comments.

## Resolving merge conflicts

To sync your branch with the base branch and resolve any merge conflicts, enter:

```copilot copy
/pr fix conflicts
```

Copilot fetches the latest base branch, syncs your branch, resolves any conflicts, and pushes the result.

### Choosing a merge strategy

When resolving conflicts, Copilot CLI needs to know whether to use a rebase or merge strategy. If you have not configured a preference, Copilot prompts you to choose when you run a command that involves conflict resolution.

To set a default merge strategy so that you are not prompted each time, add the `mergeStrategy` setting to your configuration file. You can set this in your personal user settings for Copilot, or in the repository settings.

* **User settings**: Add `"mergeStrategy": "rebase"` or `"mergeStrategy": "merge"` to your user-level configuration file (typically `~/.copilot/settings.json`).
* **Repository settings**: Add the same setting to `.github/copilot/settings.json` in your repository root.

## Fixing CI failures

To have Copilot diagnose and fix failing CI checks, enter:

```copilot copy
/pr fix ci
```

Copilot identifies the failing CI jobs, analyzes the logs to determine root causes, applies targeted fixes, and pushes them. It then re-checks the CI status and repeats the process until the checks pass or it determines that further progress is not possible.

If failures are unrelated to your branch changes, Copilot notes this clearly so you can take appropriate action.

You can append additional context to help Copilot focus on specific failures. For example:

```copilot copy
/pr fix ci focus on test failures
```

## Fixing all issues at once

To address all outstanding issues on a pull request in a single command, enter:

```copilot copy
/pr fix
```

This runs three phases in order:

1. **Review feedback** — Addresses all review comments.
2. **Conflicts** — Syncs the branch with the base branch and resolves any conflicts.
3. **CI failures** — Diagnoses and fixes failing CI checks.

## Automating the full pull request workflow

To have Copilot manage the entire pull request process from creation to a fully green state, enter:

```copilot copy
/pr auto
```

If no pull request exists for the current branch, Copilot creates one first. It then loops through the fix phases—review feedback, conflicts, and CI—repeating until there are no more review comments, no conflicts, and all CI checks pass.

You can append instructions to guide the pull request creation. For example:

```copilot copy
/pr auto include migration notes in the description
```
