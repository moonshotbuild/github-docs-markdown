# Using Copilot cloud agent from the GitHub CLI

Start and track Copilot cloud agent sessions from the GitHub CLI.

> \[!NOTE]
> The `agent-task` command set is only available in v2.80.0 or later of the GitHub CLI. This command set is a public preview and is subject to change.

## Starting a session

You can start a new Copilot cloud agent session with the `gh agent-task create` command.

When you run the command without any arguments, you are asked to enter a prompt. Copilot cloud agent acts on the prompt and opens a pull request in the current repository.

You can use command line options to:

* Provide the prompt (`gh agent-task create "Example prompt"`)
* Choose a base branch, instead of using the repository's default branch (`--base`)
* Select a repository, instead of targeting the current repository (`--repo`)
* Follow the session log in real time (`--follow`)

To see all of the available options, run `gh agent-task create --help`.

## Tracking your sessions

You can see a list of your running and past agent sessions with the `gh agent-task list` command. The output will show a list of your recent sessions.

To see more information on a specific session, use the `gh agent-task view` command. For example, to view information about the session associated with pull request #123 in the `monalisa/bookstore` repository, run `gh agent-task view --repo monalisa/bookstore 123`.

To view the session logs, add the `--log` option. Optionally, use the `--follow` option to stream live logs as the agent works.

To see all of the available options, run `gh agent-task list --help` or `gh agent-task view --help`.
