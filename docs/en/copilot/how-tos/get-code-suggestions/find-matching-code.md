## Introduction

If you allow GitHub Copilot to make suggestions that match publicly available code or use a product that does not support "Block" mode, Copilot will display references to any similar code that is found. See [GitHub Copilot code referencing](/en/copilot/concepts/completions/code-referencing).

### Prerequisites

References to matching code are only generated if you use a product that does not support "Block" mode, or if Copilot is configured to allow suggestions that match publicly available code. This is configured in either your personal or  organization settings.

For more information, see [Managing GitHub Copilot policies as an individual subscriber](/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-your-account/manage-policies#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code) or  [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-policies#policies-for-suggestion-matching).

## View code references for inline suggestions

You can view code references in the log file for your JetBrains IDE.

1. In your JetBrains IDE, select **Help** > **Show Log in Finder/Explorer**.

   The log file is displayed in your file manager. For example, for IntelliJ IDEA the log file is called `idea.log`.

2. Open the log file in your JetBrains IDE.

3. Search for "\[Public Code References]."

### Example log entry

```text
2025-02-26 09:22:12,045 [5581906] INFO - #copilot - [Public Code References] Text found matching public code in file:///Users/mona-lisa/git-repos/test-repo/fizzbuzz.js [Ln 1, Col 10] near fizzBuzz() ...:
  1) [NOASSERTION] https://github.com/nixsticks/todos/blob/ae427a721c7784da64a619ba17f60637fe1cc819/Loops/fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.js
  2) [GPL-3.0] https://github.com/voloslg/algocasts/blob/34b423517486f908ca167b390d3b8bd05653829f/exercises/fizzbuzz/index.js
```

The log entry includes the following details:

* The date and time you accepted the suggestion.
* A "Public Code References" message telling you that similar code was found.
* The path to the file in which the suggestion was added.
* The line and column number where the suggestion was added.
* A list of matches, including:
  * The license type for the matching code—or `NOASSERTION` if no license was found.
  * The URL of the file on GitHub.com where the matching code was found.

### Verifying the code referencing functionality

You can verify that code referencing is working by prompting Copilot to add some commonly used code and checking the output in the log.

1. Create a file called `fizz-buzz.js` and open it in the editor.

2. Display the log as described in the previous section.

3. In the editor, type:

   ```javascript
   function fizzBuzz()
   ```

   With a space after the closing parenthesis.

   GitHub Copilot should suggest code to complete the function. Typically the suggestion will be a common implementation of the fizz buzz algorithm that will match publicly available code on the GitHub website.

4. To accept the suggestion, press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

5. Check whether any entries for similar code have been added to the log.

## View code references for inline suggestions

You can find code references in one of the GitHub Copilot logs in Visual Studio Code.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **Output** window by selecting **View** > **Output** from the menu bar.
2. In the dropdown menu at the right of the **Output** window, select **GitHub Copilot Log (Code References)**.
3. Leave the **GitHub Copilot Log (Code References)** view displayed while you use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

   When you accept an inline suggestion that matches code in a public GitHub repository, an entry is added to the log.

   The log entry includes the following details:

   * The date and time you accepted the suggestion.
   * The name of the file in which the suggestion was added.
   * "Similar code at" followed by the location in the file where the suggestion was added.
   * An extract of the code that was added by the inline suggestion.
   * The license type for the matching code, if found, otherwise `unknown`.
   * The URL of the file on GitHub.com where the similar code was found.

## View code references for inline suggestions

You can find code references in the GitHub Copilot log in Visual Studio.

1. In the menu bar, click **View**.
2. In the dropdown menu, click **Output**.
3. In Output view, click the box to the right of "Show output from" and select **GitHub Copilot**.
4. Leave the log displayed while you use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

   When you accept an inline suggestion that matches code in a public GitHub repository, an entry is added to the log.

   The log entry includes the following details:

   * The time you accepted the suggestion. Click the "Show Timestamp" clock icon if the time is not displayed.
   * The description `[Completions Public Code Match Information]`.
   * The license type for the matching code, if found, otherwise `NOASSERTION`.
   * The URL of the file on GitHub.com where the similar code was found.
