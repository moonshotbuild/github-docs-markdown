# Viewing the Copilot impact dashboard

The impact dashboard shows how deeply your organization has adopted Copilot, and how that adoption connects to pull request output.

Instead of a flat active-user count, the impact dashboard groups users into adoption cohorts based on how they engage with Copilot, and connects that engagement to pull request throughput. This gives you a more meaningful signal of adoption depth than daily or weekly active user counts alone.

For a detailed explanation of what the dashboard shows, including adoption cohorts, engagement trends, and recommendations, see [GitHub Copilot usage metrics](/en/copilot/concepts/copilot-usage-metrics/copilot-metrics).

## Prerequisite

To access Copilot usage metrics, the **"Copilot usage metrics"** policy must be enabled:

* [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your enterprise](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-enterprise-policies#defining-policies-for-your-enterprise)
* [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-policies#enabling-copilot-features-and-models-in-your-organization)

## Accessing the dashboard

1. Navigate to your enterprise. For example, from the [Enterprises](https://github.com/settings/enterprises?ref_product=ghec\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text) page on GitHub.com.
2. Click the **Insights** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Copilot impact**.

## Next steps

* To learn how to interpret cohort shifts and what action to take, see [Interpreting usage and adoption metrics for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/reference/copilot-usage-metrics/interpret-copilot-metrics#reviewing-adoption-cohorts).
* For raw per-team NDJSON data, such as for custom BI reporting, see [Team-level Copilot usage metrics](/en/copilot/reference/copilot-usage-metrics/team-level-metrics).
