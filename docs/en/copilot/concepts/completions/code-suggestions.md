# GitHub Copilot code suggestions in your IDE

Learn about Copilot code suggestions in different IDEs.

<div class="ghd-tool vscode">

## About code suggestions in Visual Studio Code

Copilot in Visual Studio Code provides two kinds of code suggestions:

* **Next edit suggestions**

  Based on the edits you are making, Copilot both predicts the location of the next edit you'll want to make and what that edit should be. To enable next edit suggestions, see [Configuring GitHub Copilot in your environment](/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/configure-in-ide#enabling-next-edit-suggestions).

* **Ghost text suggestions**

  Copilot offers coding suggestions as you type. Start typing in the editor, and Copilot provides dimmed ghost text suggestions at your current cursor location. You can also describe something you want to do using natural language within a comment, and Copilot will suggest the code to accomplish your goal.

GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. GitHub Copilot can also assist in query generation for databases, generating suggestions for APIs and frameworks, and can help with infrastructure as code development.

## Code suggestions that match public code

GitHub Copilot checks each suggestion for matches with publicly available code. Matches may be discarded or suggested with a code reference, based on the setting of the "Suggestions matching public code" policy for your account or organization. See [GitHub Copilot code referencing](/en/copilot/concepts/completions/code-referencing).

## Changing the model used for inline suggestions

You can switch the AI model that's used for Copilot inline suggestions if:

* An alternative model is currently available
* You are using the latest releases of VS Code with the latest version of the GitHub Copilot extension

Changing the model only affects Copilot ghost text suggestions. It does not affect Copilot next edit suggestions.

> \[!NOTE] The list of available models will change over time. When only one model is available for inline suggestions, the model picker will only show that model. Preview models and additional models will be added to the picker as they become available.

For details of how to switch the model for Copilot inline suggestions, see [Changing the AI model for GitHub Copilot inline suggestions](/en/copilot/how-tos/use-ai-models/change-the-completion-model).

## Effects of switching the AI model

Changing the model that's used for Copilot inline suggestions does not affect the model that's used by Copilot next edit suggestions or Copilot Chat. See [Changing the AI model for GitHub Copilot Chat](/en/copilot/how-tos/use-ai-models/change-the-chat-model).

There are no changes to the data collection and usage policy if you change the AI model.

If you are on a Copilot Free plan, all completions count against your completions quota regardless of the model used. See [Plans for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/get-started/plans#comparing-copilot-plans).

The setting to enable or disable suggestions that match public code is applied irrespective of which model you choose. See [Finding public code that matches GitHub Copilot suggestions](/en/copilot/how-tos/get-code-suggestions/find-matching-code).

## Enabling the model switcher

If you have a Copilot Free or Copilot Pro plan, the model switcher for Copilot inline suggestions is automatically enabled.

If you're using a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, the organization or enterprise that provides your plan must enable the **Editor preview features** setting. See [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your organization](/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-policies#enabling-copilot-features-and-models-in-your-organization) or [Managing policies and features for GitHub Copilot in your enterprise](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-enterprise-policies#defining-policies-for-your-enterprise).
