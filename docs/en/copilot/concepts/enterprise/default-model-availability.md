# About default availability of Copilot models

A policy controls whether unconfigured models default to enabled or disabled.

For enterprises with Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plans, the **Default availability for released models** policy controls whether unconfigured generally available (GA) models default to enabled or disabled. If this policy is enabled, users benefit from the latest models without the need for administrator intervention.

## Which models follow the policy?

The default policy applies to models that you have not explicitly configured. These models are indicated in your enterprise or organization's model settings with the **Delegate to Default Policy** label. When a new model is released, it inherits the default until you explicitly configure it.

The following models are **not** in scope. They are disabled by default, regardless of your "Default availability" policy setting.

* Pre-GA models
* Open weight models (DeepSeek, Kimi K2.7 Code, Kimi K3)
* Models that are not covered by GitHub's data retention agreement (Claude Fable 5, Claude Fable 5.1)
* For enterprises that have restricted models to data-resident or FedRAMP-compliant models, any models that do not respect these policies

## How do I prevent default enablement?

To disable default enablement entirely, disable the **Default availability for released models** policy in your enterprise or organization's models policies. You can set a policy for the entire enterprise, or disable the policy only in organizations with stricter compliance requirements.

If you keep the **Default availability for released models** policy enabled, you can explicitly disable individual models so that they are not eligible for automatic enablement.

For instructions on managing model policies, see [Managing availability of models in your enterprise](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-availability-of-default-models) and [Managing the availability of models in an organization](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-default-models).

## How do I prepare for new models?

We recommend keeping up with new model releases so you can choose your enablement settings for each one. New models are announced on GitHub's changelog.
