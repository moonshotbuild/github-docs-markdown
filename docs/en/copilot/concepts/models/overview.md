# Models in GitHub Copilot

Understand the types and availability of AI models in GitHub Copilot.

## About models in Copilot

GitHub Copilot supports a range of AI models. Different models have different strengths. For example, some prioritize low latency, while others are optimized for complex reasoning or large context windows. For a full list of supported models, see [Supported AI models in GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models).

Depending on the surface you're using, your plan, and any policies your organization or enterprise has set, you can often **choose** which model handles your request, or **let auto model selection choose** one for you. Model choice affects the speed, cost, and quality of your results, so understanding your options helps you get the most out of every feature.

In addition, Copilot also has utility models that run automatically in the background, and for Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise, base and long-term support (LTS) models for extended stability.

## Model choice

When you're using Copilot, whether that's on GitHub, Copilot CLI, the GitHub Copilot app and supported IDEs, you can select the model that best suits your task. For guidance on which model fits common tasks, such as general-purpose coding, large-scale refactors, or documentation writing, see [AI model comparison](/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison).

### What determines which models are available to you

The models you see in Copilot depend on several factors:

* **Your plan.** Some models are available on all plans, while others, such as premium models, require a paid plan. See [Plans for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/get-started/plans).
* **The Copilot surface or client you're using.** Not every model is available in every IDE, on GitHub, in Copilot CLI, or in the GitHub Copilot app. See [Supported AI models in GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models#supported-ai-models-per-client).
* **Administrator policies.** If you're part of an organization or enterprise, administrators can enable or disable specific models, which affects what you and auto model selection can use. See [Configuring access to AI models in GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/set-up-copilot/configure-access-to-ai-models).
* **Model availability over time.** Providers periodically release new models and retire older ones, so the specific models available to you can change. Check [Supported AI models in GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models) for the current list.

## Auto model selection

Rather than requiring you to track every model's strengths yourself, you can select **Auto** in the model picker. Auto model selection then routes your request to an appropriate supported model based on the complexity of your task and real-time model availability. See [About Copilot auto model selection](/en/copilot/concepts/models/auto-model-selection).

## Bring your own key

With bring your own key (BYOK), you (or your enterprise) can connect a custom or provider-hosted model to Copilot. Availability depends on the mechanism you use and the client you're working in. See [Bring your own key for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/concepts/models/bring-your-own-key).

## Utility models for background features

Some Copilot features, such as generating a commit message or a chat session title, run on small utility models that work automatically in the background. Utility models aren't part of the model picker, and you can't select them directly. See [Utility models](/en/copilot/concepts/models/utility-models).

## Base and long-term support models

Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise accounts have access to two additional model designations:

* A **base model** is used automatically when no other model is enabled for the account.
* A **long-term support (LTS) model** is supported for a defined extended period of time, currently one year from its designation date.

See [Base and long-term support (LTS) models](/en/copilot/concepts/models/fallback-and-lts-models).
