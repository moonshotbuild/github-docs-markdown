# About GitHub Copilot Spaces

Understand how organizing and sharing context with Copilot Spaces can improve your Copilot Chat in GitHub results and help your collaborators.

Copilot Spaces let you organize the context that Copilot uses to answer your questions. Spaces can include repositories, code, pull requests, issues, free-text content like transcripts or notes, images, and file uploads. You can ask Copilot questions grounded in that context, or share the space with your team, or share publicly, to support collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Why use Copilot Spaces?

Whether you’re working solo or collaborating across a team, Spaces help you make Copilot more useful.

With Copilot Spaces you can:

* Get more relevant, specific answers from Copilot.
* Stay in flow by collecting what you need for a task in one place.
* Reduce repeated questions by sharing knowledge with your team.
* Support onboarding and reuse with self-service context that lives beyond chat history.

Your spaces stay in sync as your project evolves. GitHub files and other GitHub-based sources added to a space are automatically updated as they change, making Copilot an evergreen expert in your project.

## Who can use Spaces?

Anyone with a Copilot license, including Copilot Free, can create and use Spaces.

## Who can I share Spaces with?

Spaces can belong to a personal account or to an organization, and the sharing options differ depending on who the space belongs to.

### Organization-owned spaces

Organization-owned spaces can be shared with other organization members, and you decide which level of access you want to grant other members (admin, editor, viewer).

Alternatively, you can choose to grant "No access" to organization members, and keep the space hidden.

### Individual-owned spaces

Spaces belonging to a personal account can be shared publicly, shared with specific GitHub users, or kept private to the person who created the space.

Publicly shared spaces are view-only by default.

Viewers can only see sources that they have access to.

Eligibility to create or use Spaces is user-based and depends on the organization that grants the user a Copilot seat. Currently, the system does not block the creation of a space under an organization that has not configured Spaces, or has Spaces disabled. This means users can create spaces in such organizations if their Copilot seat comes from another organization where Spaces are enabled.

## Where can I use Spaces?

You can use Copilot Spaces in Copilot Chat in GitHub. You can also leverage Copilot Spaces in your IDE, using the GitHub MCP server in your IDE to access context from your spaces.

## How does using Spaces affect my usage?

Questions you submit in a space count as Copilot Chat requests and consume AI credits based on the model used and the number of tokens processed.

* If you're a Copilot Free user, this usage counts toward your monthly chat limit.
* For Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise, usage draws from your enterprise's shared AI credits pool. For details on how consumption is calculated, see [Usage-based billing for organizations and enterprises](/en/copilot/concepts/billing/usage-based-billing-for-organizations-and-enterprises).
