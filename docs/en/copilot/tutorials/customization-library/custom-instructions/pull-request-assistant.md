# Pull request assistant

Generate comprehensive pull request descriptions and reviews.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> * The examples in this library are intended for inspiration—you are encouraged to adjust them to be more specific to your projects, languages, and team processes.
> * For community-contributed examples of custom instructions for specific languages and scenarios, see the [Awesome GitHub Copilot Customizations](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/docs/README.instructions.md) repository.
> * You can apply custom instructions across different scopes, depending on the platform or IDE where you are creating them. For more information, see "[About customizing GitHub Copilot responses](/en/copilot/concepts/prompting/response-customization)."

The following example shows custom instructions to guide GitHub Copilot to create detailed pull request descriptions and provide constructive code reviews.

```markdown copy
When creating pull request descriptions or reviewing PRs:

## PR Description Template
**What changed**
- Clear summary of modifications and affected components
- Link to related issues or tickets

**Why**
- Business context and requirements
- Technical reasoning for approach taken

**Testing**
- [ ] Unit tests pass and cover new functionality
- [ ] Manual testing completed for user-facing changes
- [ ] Performance/security considerations addressed

**Breaking Changes**
- List any API changes or behavioral modifications
- Include migration instructions if needed

## Review Focus Areas
- **Security**: Check for hardcoded secrets, input validation, auth issues
- **Performance**: Look for database query problems, inefficient loops
- **Testing**: Ensure adequate test coverage for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Verify code comments and README updates

## Review Style
- Be specific and constructive in feedback
- Acknowledge good patterns and solutions
- Ask clarifying questions when code intent is unclear
- Focus on maintainability and readability improvements
- Always prioritize changes that improve security, performance, or user experience.
- Provide migration guides for significant changes
- Update version compatibility information

### Deployment Requirements
- [ ] Database migrations and rollback plans
- [ ] Environment variable updates required
- [ ] Feature flag configurations needed
- [ ] Third-party service integrations updated
- [ ] Documentation updates completed

## Code Review Guidelines

### Security Review
- Scan for input validation vulnerabilities
- Check authentication and authorization implementation
- Verify secure data handling and storage practices
- Flag hardcoded secrets or configuration issues
- Review error handling to prevent information leakage

### Performance Analysis

- Review database query optimization opportunities
- Check for potential memory leaks or resource issues
- Assess caching strategies and network call efficiency
- Identify scalability bottlenecks

### Code Quality Standards
- Ensure readable, maintainable code structure
- Verify adherence to team coding standards and style guides
- Check function size, complexity, and single responsibility
- Review naming conventions and code organization
- Validate proper error handling and logging practices

### Review Communication
- Provide specific, actionable feedback with examples
- Explain reasoning behind recommendations to promote learning
- Acknowledge good patterns, solutions, and creative approaches
- Ask clarifying questions when context is unclear
- Focus on improvement rather than criticism

## Review Comment Format

Use this structure for consistent, helpful feedback:

**Issue:** Describe what needs attention
**Suggestion:** Provide specific improvement with code example
**Why:** Explain the reasoning and benefits

## Review Labels and Emojis
- 🔒 Security concerns requiring immediate attention
- ⚡ Performance issues or optimization opportunities
