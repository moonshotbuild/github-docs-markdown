# Creating templates

Copilot Chat can help you create templates to streamline your workflow and ensure consistency across your projects.

GitHub Copilot Chat can help you create templates for various purposes, such as project documentation, code snippets, or issue tracking. By using templates, you can streamline your workflow and ensure consistency across your projects.

## Example scenario

You want to create a template for a project README file that includes sections for project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. You can ask Copilot Chat to generate a README template based on best practices and your specific requirements. You can then use this template as a starting point for all your project documentation.

## Example prompt

```text copy
Create a README template for a new open-source project that includes sections for project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. Make it clear and easy to follow.
```

## Example response

> \[!NOTE] The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

Copilot will provide you with a structured README template. You can copy the template Copilot Chat provides and customize it further to fit your project's needs.
