# Piloting GitHub Copilot cloud agent in your organization

Follow best practices to enable Copilot cloud agent in your organization.

<!--JTBD: When rolling out Copilot cloud agent, I want to understand use cases and follow best practices, so I can ensure I'm using it as intended and get value from a pilot program.-->

Copilot cloud agent is an autonomous, AI-powered agent that completes software development tasks on GitHub. Adopting Copilot cloud agent in your organization frees your engineering teams to spend more time thinking strategically and less time making routine fixes and maintenance updates in a codebase.

Copilot cloud agent:

* **Joins your team**: Developers can delegate work to Copilot unlike IDE-based agents that require synchronous pairing sessions. Copilot opens draft pull requests for team members to review and iterates based on feedback, as a developer would.
* **Reduces context switching**: Developers working in JetBrains IDEs, VS Code, Visual Studio, or GitHub.com can ask Copilot cloud agent to create a pull request to complete small tasks without stopping what they are currently doing.
* **Executes tasks in parallel**: Copilot can work on multiple issues simultaneously, handling tasks in the background while your team focuses on other priorities.

## 1. Evaluate

Before enabling Copilot cloud agent for members, understand how Copilot cloud agent will fit into your organization. This will help you evaluate whether Copilot cloud agent is suitable for your needs and plan communications and training sessions for developers.

1. Learn about Copilot cloud agent, including the costs and how it differs from other AI tools your developers may be used to. See [About GitHub Copilot cloud agent](/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent).
2. Learn about the tasks that Copilot cloud agent is best suited for. These are generally well-defined and scoped issues, such as increasing test coverage, fixing bugs or flaky tests, or updating config files or documentation. See [Best practices for using GitHub Copilot to work on tasks](/en/copilot/tutorials/cloud-agent/get-the-best-results).
3. Consider how Copilot cloud agent fits alongside other tools in your organization's workflows. For an example scenario that walks through how to use Copilot cloud agent alongside other AI features on GitHub, see [Integrating agentic AI into your enterprise's software development lifecycle](/en/copilot/tutorials/roll-out-at-scale/enable-developers/integrate-ai-agents).

## 2. Secure

Build on Copilot cloud agent's built-in protections before enabling it in an organization. See [Building guardrails for GitHub Copilot cloud agent](/en/copilot/tutorials/cloud-agent/build-guardrails).

## 3. Pilot

> \[!TIP] You need a paid Copilot plan to use Copilot cloud agent.

As with any other change to working practices, it's important to run a trial to learn how to deploy Copilot cloud agent effectively in your organization or enterprise.

1. Gather a cross-functional team for the trial to bring different roles, backgrounds, and perspectives to the project. This will make it easier to ensure that you explore a broad range of ways to define issues, assign work to Copilot, and give clear review feedback.
2. Choose an isolated or low-risk repository, for example, one that contains documentation or internal tools. You could create a fresh repository to use as a playground, but Copilot needs context to be successful, so you would need to add a lot of context, including team processes, development environment, and common dependencies.
3. Enable Copilot cloud agent in the repository and optionally enable third-party MCP servers for enhanced context sharing. See [Adding GitHub Copilot cloud agent to your organization](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/add-copilot-cloud-agent).
4. Create repository instructions and pre-install any tools required in the development environment Copilot uses. See [Configure the development environment](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/customize-the-agent-environment).
5. Identify a few compelling use cases for your organization, for example: test coverage or improving accessibility. See [Choose the right type of tasks to give to Copilot](/en/copilot/tutorials/cloud-agent/get-the-best-results#choosing-the-right-type-of-tasks-to-give-to-copilot) in the best practice guide.
6. Use best practice to create or refine issues for Copilot in your pilot repository.
7. Assign issues to Copilot and prepare team members to review its work.
8. Spend time looking at the codebase or documentation in VS Code or GitHub.com, asking Copilot to create a pull request to fix any bugs or small improvements that you identify.

Over the course of the trial, the team should iterate on the repository instructions, installed tools, access to MCP servers, and issue definition to identify how your organization can get the most from Copilot cloud agent. This process will help you identify your organization's best practices for working with Copilot and plan an effective rollout strategy.

In addition to giving you insight into how to set up Copilot cloud agent for success, you'll learn how Copilot consumes AI credits and GitHub Actions minutes. This will be valuable when you come to set and manage your budget for a broader trial or full rollout. See [Optimizing your budget configuration](/en/copilot/tutorials/budgets/optimizing-your-budget-configuration).

### Enhancing with MCP

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how applications share context with large language models (LLMs). MCP provides a standardized way to provide Copilot cloud agent with access to different data sources and tools.

Copilot cloud agent has access to the full GitHub context of the repository it's working in, including issues and pull requests, using the built-in GitHub MCP server. By default, it's restricted from accessing external data by authentication barriers and a firewall.

You can extend the information available to Copilot cloud agent by giving it access to local MCP servers for the tools your organization uses. For example, you might want to provide access to local MCP servers for some of the following contexts:

* **Project planning tools**: Allow Copilot direct access to private planning documents that are stored outside GitHub in tools like Notion or Figma.
* **Augment training data**: Each LLM contains training data up to a specific cut-off date. If you're working with fast moving tools, Copilot may not have access to information on new features. You can fill this knowledge gap by making the tool's MCP server available. For example, adding the Terraform MCP server will give Copilot access to the most recently supported Terraform providers.

For more information, see [Configure MCP servers for your repository](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/configure-mcp-servers).

## Next steps

When you're satisfied with the pilot, you can:

* Enable Copilot cloud agent in more organizations or repositories.
* Identify more use cases for Copilot cloud agent and train developers accordingly.
* Continue to collect feedback and measure results.

To assess the impact of a new tool, we recommend measuring the tool's impact on your organization's downstream goals. For a systematic approach to driving and measuring improvements in engineering systems, see GitHub's [Engineering System Success Playbook](https://resources.github.com/engineering-system-success-playbook/).
