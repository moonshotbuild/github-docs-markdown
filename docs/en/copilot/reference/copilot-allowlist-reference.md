# Copilot allowlist reference

Learn how to allow certain traffic through your firewall or proxy server for Copilot to work as intended in your organization.

If your company employs security measures like a firewall or proxy server, you should add the URLs in this article to an allowlist to ensure Copilot works as expected. Users must be able to authenticate to GitHub and access the Copilot service on GitHub.com or GHE.com.

Every user of the proxy server or firewall also needs to configure their own environment to connect to Copilot. See [Configuring network settings for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/configure-network-settings).

## Copilot on GitHub.com

We recommend using the `/meta` API endpoint to find the domains required to use GitHub on a restricted network. For more information, see [Allowing access to GitHub's services from a restricted network](/en/get-started/using-github/allowing-access-to-githubs-services-from-a-restricted-network).

The following request returns most of the wildcard domains required to authenticate and connect to Copilot on GitHub.com. There are some exceptions for specific services, or if you want to allow traffic only for users with specific Copilot plans.

```shell copy
gh api meta -q '.domains | .website, .copilot'
```

In addition to these domains, we recommend allowing the apex domain `github.com`. This is not covered by `*.github.com` and is not returned by the above query, although it is returned by the API under `domains.actions`.

### Specific required domains

The following table lists specific domains required for Copilot. If you have already allowed the wildcard domains returned by the `/meta` endpoint, you will have already implicitly allowed most of these domains.

## Copilot on GHE.com

If you use GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, your enterprise and GitHub's services are hosted on a unique subdomain of GHE.com.

1. Allow access to the following domains, which cover most required services.

   * `https://*.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com`
   * `https://SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com`

   Replace SUBDOMAIN with your enterprise slug.

2. If you plan to use public code detection, allow access to `https://origin-tracker.githubusercontent.com`. This is required to check generated code against public code hosted on GitHub.com. For more information, see [GitHub Copilot code referencing](/en/copilot/concepts/completions/code-referencing).

All other domains that are required on GitHub.com are **not** required on GHE.com. For example:

* Individual services have a dedicated endpoint on your subdomain (such as `https://copilot-proxy.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/`)
* Client experimentation is disabled on GHE.com, so `https://default.exp-tas.com` is not required
* Individual Copilot plans are not available on GHE.com, so subscription-based network routing (such as `https://*.individual.githubcopilot.com`) is not supported

## Editor-specific requirements

In addition to the URLs required to connect to Copilot, you must ensure your network rules meet the requirements of the local client (for example, outbound requests to `vscode.dev` in Visual Studio Code). Find the documentation for your chosen client, for example:

* [Network Connections in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/network) in the Visual Studio documentation
* [Install and use Visual Studio and Azure Services behind a firewall or proxy server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-and-use-visual-studio-behind-a-firewall-or-proxy-server) in the Microsoft documentation

## Copilot voice features

Voice features in GitHub Copilot CLI and the GitHub Copilot app use Foundry Local to run a speech-to-text model on your machine. To query the model catalog and download models, these features make outbound requests to the following Azure domains. If you want to use voice features behind a firewall or proxy server, add these URLs to your allowlist:

| Domain and/or URL                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Copilot cloud agent recommended allowlist

The Copilot cloud agent includes a built-in firewall with a recommended allowlist that is enabled by default. The recommended allowlist allows access to:

* Common operating system package repositories (for example, Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat).
* Common container registries (for example, Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, AWS Elastic Container Registry).
* Packages registries used by popular programming languages (C#, Dart, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Swift).
* Common certificate authorities (to allow SSL certificates to be validated).
* Hosts used to download web browsers for the Playwright MCP server.

For more information about configuring the Copilot cloud agent firewall, see [Customizing or disabling the firewall for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/customize-the-agent-firewall).
