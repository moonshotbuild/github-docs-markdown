# Metrics data properties for GitHub Copilot

See how GitHub calculates properties from APIs and reports.

## `last_activity_at`

> \[!NOTE] This data is in public preview and subject to change.

The timestamp of a user's most recent interaction with Copilot functionality.

### Surfaces

This property is consistent across the following surfaces:

* The CSV report downloaded from the "Access management" page (see [Reviewing user activity data for GitHub Copilot in your organization](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/review-activity/review-user-activity-data))
* The [REST API endpoints for Copilot user management](/en/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management)

### Calculation

The following interactions count as activity:

* Receiving a code suggestion in an IDE
* Chatting with Copilot Chat in an IDE
* Generating a pull request summary
* Interacting with Copilot Chat in GitHub
* Interacting with Copilot on a mobile device
* Interacting with Copilot Chat for CLI

The tracked events come from both client- and server-side telemetry, ensuring the timestamp is durable if network conditions affect client-side telemetry.

Processing new telemetry events and updating a user's `last_activity_at` date can take up to 24 hours. Users must have telemetry enabled in their IDE for their usage to be reflected in `last_activity_at`.

### Retention period

* The retention period for `last_activity_at` data is 90 days. This cannot be modified.
* After 90 days of no new activity, a user's `last_activity_at` value is set to `nil`.

For more information, see [Updating retention period for `last_activity_at` values on the Copilot user management API to 90 days](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-17-updating-retention-period-for-last_activity_at-values-on-the-user-management-api-public-preview-to-90-days/) on the GitHub Blog.

## Copilot activity report

The Copilot activity report shows user activity data for an organization or enterprise.

Data in the report refreshes automatically every 30 minutes.

### Fields

### Retention period

Activity and authentication data are retained for a rolling 90-day period, consistent with the `last_activity_at` field.

### Included features

The activity report provides visibility into usage of all generally available (GA) GitHub Copilot features in the IDE, on GitHub, in GitHub CLI, and on GitHub Mobile.

#### IDE features

* Inline suggestions
* Next edit suggestions
* Copilot Chat
* Agent mode
* Copilot Edits in VS Code

#### GitHub features

* Copilot Chat
* Copilot cloud agent
* Copilot for Docs
* Copilot pull request summaries
* Copilot code review

### Limitations

There is a possibility that GitHub lacks consistent telemetry from some third party IDEs outside of VS Code (such as JetBrains and Xcode). Users should ensure they're running the latest version of their IDE.

The activity report may exclude usage of GitHub Copilot features that are not yet generally available (GA). Currently, the following features are not fully recorded:

* Copilot Spaces
* Copilot Spark
