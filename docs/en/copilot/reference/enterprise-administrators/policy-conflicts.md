# Feature availability when GitHub Copilot policies conflict in organizations

Delegating Copilot policy decisions to organizations affects users granted a license by organizations with different policies.

## About delegating policy decisions to organizations

Policies can be defined for a whole enterprise, or set at the organization level. See [GitHub Copilot policies for enterprises and organizations](/en/copilot/concepts/policies).

When an enterprise owner delegates control of a policy to organization owners by setting "No policy," some organizations may enable a feature while others disable it. Users may be granted a Copilot license by organizations with different policies for the same feature.

## How availability is determined

Feature, model, and privacy settings for users are set according to the **least restrictive** or the **most restrictive** policy defined by any of the organizations where they are granted a Copilot license.

* **Least restrictive:** if any of the organizations has **enabled** a feature, this feature is enabled for the user everywhere. This applies to all but the more sensitive Copilot features.

* **Most restrictive:** if any of the organizations has **disabled** a feature, this feature is disabled for the user in all their organizations. This applies only to the most sensitive Copilot features, for example: access to Copilot metrics using the API.

## Availability for members with Copilot from multiple organizations

<!--The table below uses the following sort order:
    1. Policies with "Most restrictive" at the top in alphabetic order.
    2. Follow with remaining policies in alphabetic order.-->

## Availability for members with Copilot from multiple enterprises

If a user receives a license from multiple different enterprises, the **most restrictive** policy usually applies. The exceptions are:

* AI credit paid usage (this applies to each enterprise, not the user)
* GitHub Spark
