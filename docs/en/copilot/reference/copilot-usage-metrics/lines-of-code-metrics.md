# Lines of Code metrics

Lines of Code metrics provide a directional measure of Copilot output by quantifying the lines of code suggested, added, or deleted across completions, chat, and agent features.

Lines of Code (LoC) metrics provide a directional measure of Copilot’s output by quantifying the lines it suggested, added, or deleted across completions, chat, and agent features.

## Where LoC metrics appear

You may encounter LoC metrics in:

* **Code generation dashboard (enterprise and organization level)** — visualizes LoC-based user and agent activity. See [Viewing the code generation dashboard](/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/view-code-generation).
* **Exports and APIs (enterprise, organization, and user level)** — expose LoC fields such as `loc_suggested_to_add_sum`, `loc_added_sum`, and `loc_deleted_sum`. See [REST API endpoints for Copilot usage metrics](/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage-metrics).
* **"Data available in Copilot usage metrics" reference** — lists all dashboard and API fields derived from LoC. See [Data available in Copilot usage metrics](/en/copilot/reference/copilot-usage-metrics/copilot-usage-metrics).

This article covers how LoC is measured and what affects its accuracy and coverage. For detailed definitions, refer to the reference article above.

## Considerations for LoC metrics

LoC metrics may vary across IDEs and versions. Keep the following considerations in mind:

* **Coverage:** Not all IDEs and users will emit LoC telemetry until they upgrade to the required versions. Reports include the `last_known_ide_version` and `last_known_plugin_version` fields so you can monitor coverage across your enterprise.
* **Stability:** As Copilot evolves, telemetry definitions may change. Expect small shifts in data as accuracy improves over time.

## Version requirements

LoC metrics require specific minimum versions of IDEs and Copilot plugins to function. Users on older versions will not contribute LoC data, which may lead to underreporting until they upgrade.

## How agent mode affects LoC metrics

Unlike completions or chat, Copilot agent does not follow a “suggest then accept” flow. Agents plan and execute multi-step tasks, often editing multiple files iteratively without explicit acceptance by the user. Because of this, LoC metrics for agent activity are measured differently.

| Behavior               | How it’s reflected in LoC metrics                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent code suggestions | Counted as `loc_suggested_to_add_sum` when visible code blocks are shown in the chat panel.                                                |
| Agent edits in files   | Counted as `loc_added_sum` and `loc_deleted_sum` under the `agent_edit` feature bucket. These edits are not included in suggested metrics. |
| Multi-file operations  | Each file edit contributes to total added and deleted lines, even if triggered by one prompt.                                              |

Example output for agent-related LoC activity:

```json
"totals_by_language_feature": [
  {
    "language": "unknown",
    "feature": "chat_panel_agent_mode",
    "code_generation_activity_count": 12,
    "code_acceptance_activity_count": 0,
    "loc_suggested_to_add_sum": 86, // code block suggestions in chat panel in agent mode
    "loc_suggested_to_delete_sum": 0,
    "loc_added_sum": 5, // only includes code block copy or apply in chat panel, not agent edits
    "loc_deleted_sum": 0
  },
  {
    "language": "unknown",
    "feature": "agent_edit",
    "code_generation_activity_count": 345,
    "code_acceptance_activity_count": 0,
    "loc_suggested_to_add_sum": 0,
    "loc_suggested_to_delete_sum": 0,
    "loc_added_sum": 2342, // agent and edit mode edits in files
    "loc_deleted_sum": 947
  }
]
```

For a single agent edit, you may see metrics such as:

```json
"user_initiated_interaction_count": 0,
"code_generation_activity_count": 1,
"code_acceptance_activity_count": 0
```
